# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**Chairman's Letter**

Dear Fellow Shareholder,

The global energy market has faced its biggest year of change since the first and second oil shocks over 40 years ago. Whilst the developed world was focussing on the decarbonisation process, the tragedy in Ukraine brought into sharp relief the true need for energy security and reliability.

This flux was no more apparent than in Mongolia. The timing therefore of our first pilot production process could not be more auspicious. With the imminent production testing at Nomgon and the execution of the MOU with SBEnergy for Hydrogen in the same region, it should come as no surprise that your company was recognised yet again by the Mongolian Government as "The Best Investor of 2021".

The global energy market and the present domestic gas shortage in the Australian East Coast Market provided just the incentive we needed for the Company to acquire its 100% interest in the very prospective acreage in Queensland (ATP 2044) close to existing infrastructure. The troubling global events of the last 24 months have made it crystal clear that what the democratic world needs is reliable gas sourced from politically stable countries like Australia.

With over \$20 million in the bank at year end, your company can afford its exploration commitments, but you can rest assured that your board will always look at ways to continually enhance shareholder value in a riskappropriate manner.

![](_page_3_Picture_7.jpeg)

Next year will clearly help to further define your Company.

Yours sincerely,

Mr Richard Cottee *Non-Executive Chairman*

### **Overview**

During the 2022 financial year, the world started to emerge from the multiple constraints imposed by COVID-19 and I was pleased to return to Mongolia in late 2021 for the first time since early 2020. However, many supply-side constraints still exist, particularly those that require interfacing with China's ongoing strict border controls.

Elixir Energy Limited's (Elixir) team has managed to navigate its way through these shifting sands in the run-up to our (and Mongolia's) first extended pilot production program. At the date of writing all the equipment required for the program has made its way from multiple other countries to Mongolia and the gas pilot will be put on pump later this calendar year.

For the second year in a row, Mongolia's Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry officially recognised the resilience of our ongoing work program despite all the challenges that COVID-19 has thrown up, with the designation of Elixir as "Best Investor of 2021".

Our exploration and appraisal program continued through the year. Across the vast PSC area, multiple wells were drilled, 2D seismic acquired and surface areas mapped. All activities were undertaken safely and environmentally responsibly.

Our strong relationships at multiple levels in Mongolia facilitated the rapid development of our Gobi H2 green hydrogen project during the year. This culminated in June with the execution of a MOU with SB Energy Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. Under the MOU the parties are currently working closely together to progress the Gobi H2 project.

After the fiscal year-end, we announced the acquisition of a licence in Queensland – ATP 2044 – which we consider to be highly prospective and very well located to take advantage of changes to the global and local gas markets following the geopolitically seismic event that was the invasion of Ukraine in February.

### **Nomgon PSC - Exploration & Appraisal Program**

In the fiscal year 2022, the primary focus of the Company's exploration and appraisal program was setting up Mongolia's first long-term gas pilot production project. This has involved importing equipment and personnel from a number of countries – all under the challenges posed by COVID-19 border and other supply-side restrictions.

As of the date of writing, the commencement of the pilot project is now imminent. Its primary aim is simple – to pump out water and then gas, with a view to establishing a commercial flow rate of the latter.

Achieving this would be a game changer for Mongolia – with gas having multiple possible markets in areas like power generation, transport fuels, fertiliser production, etc, - all areas in which the country is short – with the repercussions of the Ukraine war greatly exacerbating the issue of security of supply and cost of imports.

Our exploration program in the year targeted multiple sub-basins across the Nomgon PSC, using the tools of geological surveys, 2D seismic acquisition and interpretation and of course the drilling of multiple wells. Like all exploration efforts, not all wells made discoveries, but we were pleased to drill a good number of wells which encountered coals in the CBM depth window. Further evaluation work will follow up on these in the months and years to come.

### **Clean Energy - Gobi H2**

Last year we announced the establishment of a new subsidiary – GOH Clean Energy LLC – to pursue clean energy ventures in the South Gobi region. Over the course of the 2022 financial year, we have materially built upon this initiative – with a very major milestone being passed with the establishment of an early-stage partnership with Japan's SB Energy Corp (SBE). This was founded through the execution of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). SBE is a wholly owned subsidiary of one of Japan's largest companies – SoftBank Group Corp.

SBE is the operator of an existing world-class wind farm in the South Gobi and has a similar longterm experience in Mongolia to that of our team – more than a decade.

Both parties have developed a view that Southern Mongolia has the characteristics that could support giga-watt scale green hydrogen production facilities – including very strong renewable energy (wind and solar) resources and of course immediate proximity to multiple and large potential markets in China.

An important step on the road to a major export facility is a pilot plant that would serve to prove viability to multiple stakeholders such as financiers, customers, communities, etc. Elixir and SBE aim to build a pathway to a formal joint venture in the course of the 2023 fiscal year to pursue the development of a pilot.

### **ATP 2044**

After the end of the financial year, we were very pleased to announce the purchase of a 100% interest in a large and very well-located permit in Queensland: ATP 2044. Located only some 35 kilometres from Australia's premier gas hub at Wallumbilla, gas from this asset could find markets both domestically and internationally via the connected LNG export plants at Gladstone.

Our internal estimate of the prospective resources in the permit is very substantial – a mean case in excess of 3 trillion cubic feet of gas – and also 75 million barrels of associated condensate.

This permit is located in a deep tight gas play called the Taroom Trough, which was the subject of an initial drilling evaluation program by BG Group around a decade ago – a program that delivered flows of gas to the surface from multiple wells. BG's successor – Shell – still holds an extensive position in the Taroom – as does Australian energy giant Santos. Elixir plans to build a drilling program in ATP 2044 that is coordinated as much as possible with the drilling plans of its neighbours.

### **Looking Ahead**

Elixir has expanded its portfolio to now include three areas – each of which could deliver very strong returns for shareholders.

Our foundation asset – the Nomgon CBM PSC - will soon host Mongolia's first extended pilot production program. Positive results from this will demonstrate the commerciality of CBM production in the country and therefore be a key milestone to ultimate development. Our exploration program continues in parallel to de-risk resources in the PSC.

The Gobi H2 project is based on two key advantages that Mongolia possesses – world-class renewable resources and a location immediately proximate to the world's largest energy importing nation. We are currently working very closely with our new partner SB Energy to move forward with an initial pilot green hydrogen project – as a demonstration of the multi-gigawatt potential in the region.

The acquisition post-financial year end of ATP 2044 in Queensland gives the company an asset that is exceptionally well placed to benefit from the global energy market storms that the invasion of Ukraine has provoked. Elixir's Australian team is very familiar with Queensland and our plan is to drill an appraisal well in this tenement in 2023.

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**Operational Summary and Resource Statement**

In the reporting year ended 30 June 2022, Elixir acquired 673 km of 2D seismic and drilled 17 wells in the Nomgon IX PSC (Figure 1). The wells were a combination of exploration and appraisal wells. This brought the total number of well drilled in the PSC since it was executed in 2018, to 33.

*Figure 1: Drilling and Seismic Activity in Nomgon IX*

### **Coal Bed Methane Drilling**

The Company's Coal Bed Methane (CBM) wells were drilled with a combination of chip-hole and coring drilling techniques. The technique to be used is generally at the discretion of the drilling subcontractor – Elixir generally pays for wells by the metre drilled. At Elixir's discretion, cores can be taken to measure for various key CBM parameters such as gas content.

Over 12,100m has been drilled, and a total of 330m of coal and a further 155m of silty coal was intersected.

During the fiscal year, three separate Mongolian owned drilling sub-contractors have been used. Post the year end, this has been supplemented with international firm Major Drilling, who has been engaged to drill pilot and exploration wells (Figure 2).

*Figure 2: Major Drilling at Nomgon IX*

### **2D Seismic**

A total of 673 km of seismic was acquired during the financial year. The 2D seismic is fundamental in defining the sedimentary depocentres and providing high-resolution stratigraphic information which is critical for our well planning. The 2D seismic was acquired by Microseismic LLC, who is an experienced local Mongolian Seismic Contractor.

The seismic crew was in the field for 128 days between 24 September 2021 and 20 May 2022. The crew often work throughout the night as there is less wind noise in the evening, improving the quality of the data acquired.

### **Nomgon IX Contingent Resource**

In the fiscal year ended 30 June 2022, a key focus of Elixir's program has been setting up a long term pilot production program – whose aim is to flow gas at commercial rates, hence facilitating a maiden reserves booking. Considerable logistical efforts were undertaken during the year to import all the equipment required from multiple countries.

Post the balance sheet date, the drilling of wells for this pilot commenced and the Company anticipates flowing water and gas therefrom later in 2022.

The intended reserve booking builds upon the site specific contingent resources booked during the previous fiscal year ended 30 June 2021, when Elixir announced its first Contingent Resource booking. The Independent Contingent Resource estimate was undertaken by ERCE Equipoise (ERCE). The Contingent Resources have been booked only for the initial selected gas supply area for a potential power project – the Western part of the Nomgon sub-basin in which the Company drilled a number of wells in 2020.

| Contingent Resources (100% WI)   |    |    |     |  |
|----------------------------------|----|----|-----|--|
| Bcf                              | 1C | 2C | 3C  |  |
| Gas initially in place<br>(GIIP) | 13 | 60 | 242 |  |
| Recoverable Gas                  | 5  | 24 | 104 |  |

*Table 2: Nomgon Contingent Resource*

Detailed notes on the background to the preparation of the Contingent Resources report are set out in ASX Announcement released on April 7, 2021.

### **PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES**

Elixir Energy Limited ("Company") and its subsidiaries ("Group") is an exploration company focused on coal bed methane ("CBM") exploration and development in Mongolia. The Group holds a Production Sharing Contract in southern Mongolia, which was awarded in late 2018 and covers an area of approximately 30,000 square kilometres. Further details are contained in the Managing Director's Report provided earlier in the 2022 Annual Report and in the Review of Operations below.

### **REVIEW OF OPERATIONS**

### **Operating Results**

For the financial year ended 30 June 2022, the Group recorded a net loss from continuing operations after tax of \$2 million (2021: loss of \$1.5 million). The current year loss is increased by \$0.5 million comparing to the prior year, reflecting a largely unchanged corporate cost structure with all costs related to the Mongolian CBM project capitalised. It is noted that the current year loss includes approximately \$0.5 million (2021: \$0.1 million) (net) of non-cash items for share-based remuneration; new ventures \$0.34 million; offset by \$0.4 million (2021: loss \$0.1 million) foreign currency translation gain. The 'cash loss' for the year of approximately \$1.6 million (2021: \$1.3 million) reflects the Group's operating/administrative costs of approximately \$0.137 million per month.

At 30 June 2022, the Group held cash of just under \$22.7 million (2021: \$32.8 million), representing funds raised in the last quarter of the 2021 financial year from a Share placement and Share Purchase Plan of \$26.6 million (\$25.9 million after costs). During the year, the Group spent approximately \$8 million (2021: \$3.7 million) on the CBM project in Mongolia, described in more detail below.

### **Operations Review**

During the financial year, the Group's primary focus was conducting an exploration and appraisal program in the Nomgon IX CBM PSC.

Each year the Company undertakes a regulatory process involving procuring various approvals from the petroleum, environmental and local authorities. In this financial year this facilitated the acquisition of 673 kilometres of 2D seismic and a drilling campaign in the year which comprised both low cost strat-holes and fully tested core-holes. In total 17 wells were drilled in the financial year.

During the year, Elixir made significant progress with its Gobi H2 green hydrogen project, located in the same part of the South Gobi region as its CBM operations. This culminated with the execution of a non-binding MOU with Japan's SB Energy Corp to jointly pursue this venture.

The only remaining legacy asset from Elxir's operations prior to current Management coming on board is a wholly owned subsidiary, Cottesloe Oil & Gas LLC, which held a joint venture interest in an asset in Texas, USA.

### **Changes in Capital Structure**

In November 2021, the Group acquired a new subsidiary, Solar Ilch LLC, via the issuing of 720,000 shares Ordinary EXR shares to the vendors, valued at 26 cents per share.

Total ordinary shares on issue at 30 June 2022 were 891,733,376.

There were no other significant changes to the issued capital structure during the year.

### **SHARE OPTIONS**

At the date of this report there are 6,330,000 (2021: 5,330,000) Unlisted Options over unissued ordinary shares are on issue. During the year, 1,000,000 Unlisted Options were granted and no Unlisted Options were exercised or cancelled.

### **(a) Remuneration governance**

The remuneration committee of the board of Directors of the Company is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for the Directors and key management personnel. The remuneration committee assesses the appropriateness of the nature and amount of remuneration of key management personnel on a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions with the overall objective of ensuring maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of Directors and key management personnel.

### **(b) Remuneration philosophy**

The performance of the Company, among other things, depends upon the quality of its Directors and management. To prosper, the Company must attract, motivate and retain industry skilled Directors and key management personnel. To this end, the charter adopted by the remuneration committee aims to align rewards with achievement of strategic objectives. The remuneration framework applied provides for a mixture of fixed and variable pay and a blend of short- and long-term incentives as appropriate.

Currently no remuneration consultants are used by the Group in formulating remuneration policies.

{17}------------------------------------------------

### **(c) Remuneration structure**

In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of Non-Executive Director and key management personnel remuneration is separate and distinct.

### **Non-Executive Directors**

### *Non-Executive Directors Fees*

The maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to Non-Executive Directors is subject to approval by shareholders in a general meeting. At the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 23 October 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved that the aggregate amount of Director fees payable to Non-Executive Directors of the Company be set at \$500,000 per annum in total. From September 2021, the Non-Executive Chairman fees are \$115,000 per annum (2021: \$72,000) and Non-Executive Director fees are \$70,000 per annum (2021: \$45,000).

The Group's policy is to remunerate Non-Executive Directors at market rates (for comparable companies) for time, commitment and responsibilities. Cash fees for Non-Executive Directors are not linked to the performance of the Group. However, to align Directors' interests with shareholders' interests, Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company.

### *Retirement benefits and allowances*

No retirement benefits or allowances are paid or payable to Directors of the Company (other than statutory or mandatory superannuation contributions, where applicable).

### **Key Management Personnel**

### *Base pay*

KMP receive a competitive level of base pay that comprises the fixed (unrisked) component of their pay and rewards. Base pay for senior KMP is reviewed annually to ensure market competitiveness. There are no guaranteed base pay increases included in any senior KMP contracts.

### *Short-term incentives*

Payment of short-term incentives is at the sole and absolute discretion of the remuneration committee. The remuneration committee assesses the achievement of key performance milestones to determine bonus payments. These milestones require performance in relation to key strategic, non-financial measures linked to drivers of performance in future reporting periods, refer to the current and historical performance rights milestones.

Short-term bonus payments may be adjusted up or down in line with under or over achievement relative to target performance levels at the discretion of the remuneration committee. During the year, the Managing Director was paid a short-term incentive payment of \$120,000 (2021: \$75,000) as compensation following successful exploration and other operational results in the prior financial year. There have been no forfeitures of bonuses by KMP during the current or prior periods and no cash bonuses remained unvested at year end.

### *Long term Incentive - Share-based compensation*

Options over shares in the Company and Performance Rights may be granted from time to time and are required to be approved by shareholders where option over shares or Performance Rights are issued to Directors. The Group's Employee Incentive Securities Plan ("Plan") was last approved by shareholders at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. Participation in any incentive scheme is at the board's discretion and no individual has a contractual right to participate in the Plan or to receive any guaranteed benefits. Options or Performance Rights granted under the Plan carry no dividend or voting rights. The Plan includes rules to prevent participants entering into transactions to remove the "at risk" aspect of the unvested Options or Performance Rights without the approval of the board.

# **INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ELIXIR ENERGY LIMITED**

### **Report on the Audit of the Financial Report**

### **Opinion**

We have audited the financial report of Elixir Energy Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2022, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial report, including a summary of significant accounting policies and the directors' declaration.

In our opinion the accompanying financial report of the Group, is in accordance with the *Corporations Act 2001*, including:

- (i) Giving a true and fair view of the Group's financial position as at 30 June 2022 and of its financial performance for the year ended on that date; and
- (ii) Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the *Corporations Regulations 2001*.

### **Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the *Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report* section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the *Corporations Act 2001* and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 *Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards)* (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We confirm that the independence declaration required by the *Corporations Act 2001*, which has been given to the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor's report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

### **Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide

### **Other information**

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the Group's annual report for the year ended 22 June 2022, but does not include the financial report and the auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

### **Responsibilities of the directors for the Financial Report**

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the *Corporations Act 2001* and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

{26}------------------------------------------------

### **Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website [(http://www.auasb.gov.au/Home.aspx)](http://www.auasb.gov.au/Home.aspx) at: <https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1_2020.pdf>

This description forms part of our auditor's report.

### <span id="page-33-0"></span>**1. General Information and Basis of Presentation**

Elixir Energy Limited ('Company') is a for-profit Australian incorporated publicly listed company. The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its controlled entities ('Group') and is a general-purpose report that has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, Australian Accounting Interpretations, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the *Corporations Act 2001*. The consolidated financial statements and notes also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost. All amounts are presented in Australian dollars, unless otherwise noted.

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of normal business activity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. As outlined below under *Impact of COVID-19 pandemic* the pandemic has not impacted the Group's operations in any significant way to date, and it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's planned exploration activities and operations in Mongolia nor its administrative functions in Mongolia and Australia. Should the Group's near-term planned exploration activities be delayed due to COVID-19, the Board expects that its minimum expenditure commitments under the Production Sharing Contract in Mongolia for the 2022 calendar year will be reduced, and a force majeure process under the PSC would facilitate this. The Board does not believe the pandemic will have any impact on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

### *New Accounting Standards*

There are no issued but not yet effective accounting standards or interpretations that are expected to significantly impact the Group in future financial years. A summary of the Company's accounting policies is contained in Note 26.

### *Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimates*

Estimates and judgments are incorporated into the financial statements based on historical knowledge, best available current information and expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group. Areas that involved a high degree of judgement or complexity and items that are more likely to be materially adjusted are shown below:

- (i) Review of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure impairment indicators Note 7
- (ii) Estimation of fair value of share-based payments Note 11

*Impact of COVID-19 pandemic* - Judgment has been exercised in considering the impacts that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had, or may have, on the operations of the Group and its financial position and results. At present it is not expected that the pandemic will have any significant impact on the Group's planned exploration activities and operations in Mongolia nor its administrative functions in Mongolia and Australia.

Group personnel, key supply chains, and other important stakeholder relationships have remained largely unaffected by the pandemic. As at 30 June 2022 and the date of this report, there has been no significant impact upon the financial results and position of the Group reported on in these consolidated financial statements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board and management will continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on the Group's operations and state of affairs.

There are no recognised deferred tax liabilities in the Group at 30 June 2022, as all capitalised exploration expenditure is held in Elixir Energy Ltd's Mongolian subsidiary GOH LCC and that subsidiary is not subject to income tax under the terms of the Production Sharing Contract. Future income tax that may apply through a withholding tax on repatriated funds, if any, from GOH LLC has also not been recognised as any such distributions are very uncertain at 30 June 2022 and Elixir Energy Ltd as parent can control if and when any distributions are made.

Elixir Energy Ltd has not formed a tax consolidated group with its Australian subsidiaries as at 30 June 2022. Total Australian tax losses and deductible temporary differences at 30 June 2022 were approximately \$29.3 million (\$24.6 million operating losses, \$4 million capital losses, 0.7 million deferred items). The potential tax benefit of these losses of approximately \$8.8 million (at 30% company tax rate in Australia on passive income) has not been recognised.

### *Significant accounting judgment*

The \$10.3 million (2021: \$10.4 million) of carried forward tax losses has not been recognised as a deferred tax asset as it is not considered sufficiently probable that these losses will be recouped by means of future profits taxable in the appropriate jurisdictions.

Tax losses related to historical operations in the United States are assessed as sufficient to exceed any tax liability arising from the forgiveness of intercompany loans payable by those subsidiaries upon their dissolution (refer Note 19 regarding the legal status of foreign subsidiaries).

The cash-backed site rehabilitation performance bond has been provided in favour of the former owner of the Pompano oil and gas project in Texas, United States and is held in escrow by a USA insurance company. The Group carries a site rehabilitation provision (refer Note 9) of an equivalent amount. The carrying value of the cash-backed bond reflects its fair value.

### *Credit risk*

The USA insurance company that holds the performance bond noted above has a AAA credit rating and therefore the credit risk associated with this entity is considered low. The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk with respect to any single counterparty or group of counterparties.

The rehabilitation provision relates to the Pompano oil and gas project in Texas in which a subsidiary of the Company was involved in prior years. Estimated future decommissioning and site restoration costs of an oil production platform and associated infrastructure, should they be required, are not expected to exceed the environmental performance bond the Group has lodged (refer Note 6) and therefore the provision has been carried at the same amount as the bond. There is no parent company guarantee in place between the Company and Cottesloe Oil and Gas LLC and therefore there is no formal recourse to the Company or any other subsidiary of the Group should a claim be made on Cottesloe for an amount in excess of its assets.

(1) \$nil investor relations (2021: \$150,000 investor relations) included in General Administration in Note 3.

### **(i) Fully paid ordinary shares**

Fully paid ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the parent entity in proportion to the number of shares held. At the shareholders meetings each ordinary share is entitled to one vote on a show of hands or by proxy and upon a poll each share is entitled to one vote.

### **(ii) Options and Performance Rights convertible to ordinary shares**

Refer to Note 12 for details of Options and Performance Rights on issue that are potentially convertible into fully paid ordinary shares, as well as the movement in Options and Performance Rights over the year. Note 13 contains further detail on Options and Performance Rights issued to Key Management Personnel during the financial year and the related share-based payment expense recognised.

### **(iii) Capital Risk Management**

The majority of the Group's capital is equity-based. Capital is managed by the Directors and management with a view to the Group's short and long-term financial risks as well as its operating and growth strategy. In particular, capital is sourced and managed to generate long-term shareholder value and ensure that the Group can fund its operations and continue as a going concern. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

### **11. Reserves and Accumulated Losses**

### **Reserves**

The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising on consolidation of subsidiaries with non-Australian dollar functional currencies.

The share-based payment reserve reflects the cumulative value of Options and Performance Rights issued to Group personnel and third parties in return for services that has been recognised as a sharebased payment expense or a share-issue cost. If an Option is exercised, or a Performance Rights is converted, the corresponding balance in the share-based payment reserve is reclassified to Share Capital. Upon expiry of an Option or Performance Right, the corresponding balance (if any) in the share-based payment reserve is reclassified to Retained Earnings/Accumulated Losses. Refer to Note 13 for detail on share-based payments during the year.

The Listed Option reserve reflects the cash proceeds, net of costs, from the issue of listed options.

### **Dividends**

No dividends were paid or declared during the current financial year. With respect to the payment of dividends (if any) by the Company in future financial years, no franking credits are currently available, or are likely to become available in the next 12 months.

- (2) On 21 July 2020 1,350,000 fully paid shares were issued to satisfy advisor fees in relation to capital raising (refer Note 10). The fair value of these securities was determined to be \$27,000 based on the value of the service.
### **Recognition of Share Based Payments: Options and Performance Rights**

The fair value of options and performance rights is determined at the grant date and then recognised in profit or loss over the vesting period (with the exception of listed options issued to settle certain advisor fees related to capital raising, which is accounted for as a reduction in share capital).

The fair value of listed options is determined with reference to the market value of the Company's listed options on the ASX (EXROA) at the issue date. The fair value of unlisted options is determined using an option pricing model such as the Black-Scholes model, with the key inputs being the current share price of the Company, option exercise price, term to expiry, and assumed future share price volatility. If any of the vesting conditions are 'market-based' (such as the achievement of a particular share price), these conditions are factored in to the grant date fair value assessment. The fair value of performance rights is determined based on the Company's share price at the grant date.

With respect to Performance Rights, the probability of achieving the relevant performance condition is reassessed at each reporting date and this probability factor is applied to the grant date fair value in determining the amount to be recognised for the current reporting period. If and when the relevant performance condition is met and the rights convert to a corresponding number of shares, any remaining portion of the grant date fair value that has not previously been recognised is recognised.

### *Significant accounting estimates and judgments for share-based payments*

The determination of the fair value of at grant date of equity-settled Options and Performance Rights requires the use of estimates and judgement. In particular, the values and amounts recognised as sharebased payments expense are particularly sensitive to the share price volatility assumption in valuing Options and the probability assessment of achieving performance conditions with respect to Performance Rights.

| Security               | 2022<br>\$ | 2021<br>\$ |
|------------------------|------------|------------|
| Incentive Options      | 111,425    | 118,258    |
| New Performance Rights | 355,049    | -          |
| Total                  | 466,474    | 118,258    |

Detail regarding the underlying assumptions used to value and recognise as an expense the Performance Rights and Options that were issued during the year is shown below.

### **Performance Rights**

- New Performance Rights were issued to a KMPs' and technical consultants on 28 October 2021 with performance conditions as outlined in Note 12. The grant date was determined to be 28 October 2021 and the total fair value was determined to be \$2,652,000 based on the share price at grant date of \$0.26. Total share-based payment recognised during the year was \$355,049. The remaining \$528,951 will be recognised in the twelve months to 30 June 2023.
The probability of achieving the milestone set in 2023 is considered likely at 30 June 2022 and milestones set for 2024 and 2025 are considered unlikely at 30 June 2022 and therefore only the portion of the grant date fair value related to achieving 2023 milestone is recognised.

*Accounting policy for earnings per share*

### Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year.

### Diluted earnings per share

There are no instruments excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future because they are anti-dilutive for both periods presented.

There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares that would significantly change the number of ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares outstanding between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements.

As at 30 June 2022 amounts receivable from controlled entities at cost totalled \$17,252,095 (2021: \$9,073,648). During the year there was an impairment recorded of \$650,021 (2021: \$nil) in relation to amounts receivable from controlled entities nor against the value of investments in controlled entities. Other than the commitments set out in Note 20 there are no contingent liabilities or commitments.

### *Controlled Entities*

Details of interests in wholly-owned controlled entities and a cross guarantee with one subsidiary are set out at Note 19. Elixir Energy Limited provides working capital to its controlled entities via intercompany loans, as disclosed in Note 19.

The minimum exploration work obligations under the Production Sharing Contract in Mongolia which began in 2019 are measured in calendar years. In calendar year:

- 2022 (year 4) US\$1,500,000
- 2023 (year 5) US\$2,500,000
- 2024 to 2026 (years 6 to 8) expenditure commitments are US\$10,000,000.

{49}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_49_Picture_0.jpeg)

The minimum work program expenditure obligations in the 2022 and 2023 calendar years will be reduced by the actual expenditure in excess of prior years commitment of approximately US \$2,155,000 and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the quantum of the pandemic reduction has yet to be agreed with the Mongolian petroleum regulator. Approximate expenditure commitment figures by financial year in the table above have been converted to Australian dollars at the year-end rate of \$US0.69/AU.

### **21. Contingencies**

The group has no contingent assets or liabilities as at reporting date.

### **22. Operating Segments**

General Information

### *Identification of reportable segments*

The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Managing Director (chief operating decision maker) and Board of Directors in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources.

The Group had three reportable segments during 2022 (2021: three) being oil and gas exploration in Mongolia and the United States of America and clean energy Mongolia. The Group's management and administration office is located in Australia.

Operating segment results and balances are determined in accordance with the accounting policies applied in the annual financial statements of the Group. Intercompany loan balances are eliminated for the purposes of segment reporting.

### **Allocated and Unallocated Items**

- In most instances, segment assets are clearly identifiable and allocable on the basis of their nature and physical location.
- Liabilities are allocated to segments where there is direct nexus between the incurrence of the liability and the operations of the segment.
- The following items of revenue, expense, assets and liabilities are not allocated to operating segments and instead are reported as 'Other Corporate Activities' as they are not considered part of the core operations of any segment:
	- Interest and other income
	- Corporate administration and related payables
	- Share based payments

### **Financial Risk Management Policies**

Company Management and the Audit Committee have been delegated responsibility by the Board of Directors for, amongst other issues, managing financial risk exposures of the Group. The Board monitors the Group's financial risk management policies and exposures and approves financial transactions within the scope of its authority. It also reviews the effectiveness of internal controls relating to currency risk, commodity price risk, counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. There have been no substantive changes in the types of risks the Group is exposed to, how these risks arise, or the Board's objectives, policies and processes for managing or measuring the risks from the previous period.

### **(a) Credit risk**

Exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of contract obligations that could lead to a financial loss to the Group. Credit risk is managed through a delegated approval process, establishing and monitoring credit limits, ensuring to the extent possible that counterparties to transactions are credit worthy, and monitoring of the financial stability of significant counterparties. Credit risk is also minimised by only investing surplus funds in financial institutions that maintain a high credit rating.

The maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at the end of the reporting period, excluding the value of any collateral or other security held, is equivalent to the carrying amount and classification of those financial assets (net of any provisions) as presented in the statement of financial position. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties. Details with respect to credit risk of Trade and Other Receivables is provided in Note 6.

The following table provides information regarding the credit risk relating to cash and liquid securities held with financial institutions by geographic area:

|                                      | Consolidated Group |            |  |

{51}------------------------------------------------

### **(b) Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise meeting its obligations related to its financial liabilities. The Group manages this risk through the following mechanisms:

- preparing forward-looking cash flow analyses in relation to its operational, investing and financing activities
- obtaining funding from a variety of sources
- maintaining a reputable credit profile
- only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions
- managing credit risk related to financial assets

The table below shows the contractual maturity profile of financial liabilities.

### *Financial liabilities - interest bearing*

Lease liability **60,946** - 5,560 - - - **66,506** -

### **(c) Market Risk**

### (i) *Interest rate risk*

During the year and as at the year-end reporting date, the Group had no significant interest-bearing assets or liabilities other than liquid funds on deposit. As such, the Group's income and operating cash flows (other than interest income from funds on deposit) are not significantly affected by movements in market interest rates.

### (ii) *Foreign exchange risk*

Movement in the US dollar and Mongolian tugrik (MNT) exchange rates may result in fluctuations in the fair value of or future cash flows related to the Group's financial asset and liabilities.

The Board regularly monitors the Group's foreign exchange requirements and risk including the consideration of the use of foreign exchange contracts or instrument to hedge its foreign currency risk. No such arrangements were entered into during the year, although by holding US dollar bank accounts the Group can manage its exposure to movements in the USD/AUD exchange rate regarding its future USD expenditure (in Mongolia).

The Group's exposure (in Australian dollars) to foreign currency risk at the reporting date was as follows:

|                         |           | 2022      |           | 2021      |

{52}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_52_Picture_0.jpeg)

### (iii) Commodity price risk

The Group is currently not directly exposed to movements in the prices of natural gas and crude oil as the Group's Coal Bed Methane project in Mongolia is still in the exploration and evaluation stage. The Group is indirectly affected by movements in petroleum commodity prices in terms of the impact of such movements on the Company's share price on the ASX and its consequential impact on the Group's ability to raise capital effectively.

### **Sensitivity Analysis**

The following table illustrates sensitivities to the Group's exposures to changes in interest rates and exchange rates. The table indicates the impact on reported profit/loss and net equity values for changes in rates that management considers to be reasonably possible. This analysis assumes that the movement in each variable is independent of movement in the other variable and is prepared on the same basis as the prior year.

### **(d) Fair values**

The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities at the balance date reflects their fair values. All financial instruments have a short (<12 months) time to maturity, with the exception of the following:

- 1) Performance bond held in the United States (refer Note 6) on which the timing of the settlement is uncertain.
- 2) Escrow account in Mongolia on which the timing of the settlement is uncertain.
- 3) Lease liability in Mongolia is 13 months.

### **24. Subsequent Events**

In August 2022, the Company acquired a 100% interest in petroleum exploration permit ATP 2044 via EnergyCaptute Pty Ltd. The consideration comprised \$3,000,000 of Elixir shares, \$500,000 in cash, and an over-riding 3% royalty.

There were no other events occurring after year end impacting the operations, results of operations, or state of affairs of the Group requiring disclosure in the 30 June 2022 consolidated financial statements.

### **25. Summary of Accounting Policies**

### **(a) Principles of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of entities controlled by the parent entity Elixir Energy Limited at the end of the reporting period. A controlled entity is any entity over which the parent has the ability and right to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from the entity's activities.

{53}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_53_Picture_0.jpeg)

Where controlled entities have entered or left the Group during the year, the financial performance of those entities is included only for the period of the year that they were controlled. A list of controlled entities is contained in Note 19 to the financial statements.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intragroup balances and transactions between entities in the consolidated group have been eliminated in full.

### **(b) Asset acquisitions**

When an asset acquisition does not constitute a business combination, the assets and liabilities are recorded based on their relative fair values. No deferred tax balances will arise in relation to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities under the initial recognition exemption afforded by AASB 112 *Income Taxes*. No goodwill arises on an asset acquisition and transaction costs are included in the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.

### **(c) Revenue recognition**

Interest revenue is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method described in Note 26(i).

### **(d) Income Tax**

Income tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax expense.

Current income tax expense/benefit is charged to profit or loss representing the tax payable/receivable on taxable income. Current tax liabilities/assets are measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/recovered from the relevant taxation authority. Deferred income tax expense/benefit reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year as well the recognition, if any, of previously unrecognised tax losses.

Current and deferred income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income/loss when the tax relates to items that are recognised in equity.

Except for business combinations, no deferred income tax is recognised from temporary differences stemming from the initial recognition of an asset or liability where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. Measurement of deferred tax balances reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability.

Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.

Where temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates, and joint ventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous settlement will occur in the future.

The Group does not consolidate any Australian entities for tax purposes.

### **(e) Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Value Added Tax (VAT)**

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST or value added tax (VAT), except where the amount of GST or VAT incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority.

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST or VAT receivable or payable. The net amount of GST or VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.

### **(f) Property, Plant and Equipment**

Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less, where applicable, any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

The cost of fixed assets constructed within the consolidated group includes the cost of materials, direct labour, borrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overheads.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised as expenses in profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

In the event the carrying amount of plant and equipment is greater than the estimated recoverable amount, the carrying amount is written down immediately to the estimated recoverable amount and impairment losses are recognised either in profit or loss. A formal assessment of recoverable amount is made when impairment indicators are present (refer to Note 28(g)).

The cost of property, plant and equipment, excluding freehold land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the asset's useful life commencing from the time the asset is ready for use. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

### **(g) Impairment of Assets**

At the end of each reporting period, an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. The assessment will include the consideration of external and internal sources of information including market conditions and asset-specific matters. If such an indication exists, an impairment test is carried out on the asset by comparing the asset's carrying amount to its estimated recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is determined on the basis of the expected net cash flows that will be received from the asset's employment and subsequent disposal discounted to their present values. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.

Any excess of the asset's carrying amount over its recoverable amount is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Impairment testing is performed annually for goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives.

### **(h) Exploration & evaluation expenditure**

Expenditure on exploration for and of evaluation of petroleum resources in relation to each separate area is recognised as an asset in the year the expenditure is incurred, provide rights to tenure are current and:

- it is expected that expenditure will be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale; or
- Exploration and evaluation activities are continuing in an area of interest but at reporting date have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves.

Expenditure that is capitalised as an asset includes only those costs directly related to exploration and evaluation activities.

The carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets is assessed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the asset (or the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset is allocated, being no larger than an area of interest) is based on the higher of value in use and fair values less costs to sell.

If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset or cash-generating unit is then written down to its recoverable amount with a corresponding impairment loss recognised in profit or loss. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount not to exceed the original pre-impairment carrying amount.

Once a decision has been made to proceed with development in a particular area of interest, the relevant asset/CGU is tested for impairment, reclassified to development properties and then amortised (once production commences) over the life of the petroleum reserves associated with the asset or CGU.

### **(i) Financial Instruments**

### **Recognition and Measurement**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions to the instrument. For financial assets, this is equivalent to the date that the company commits itself to either the purchase or sale of the asset (trade date).

Financial assets are classified as those measured at amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. This classification is based on two criteria: the Group's business model for managing the assets; and whether the asset's contractual cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest' on the principal amount outstanding. A financial asset can only be measured at amortised cost if both these tests are satisfied.

Trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables, are classified as amortised cost instruments. They are initially measured at fair value, which includes transaction costs and any expected credit losses, and then subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Amortised cost is calculated as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition, less principal repayments and any reduction for impairment, and adjusted for any cumulative amortisation of the difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount calculated using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is used to allocate interest income (financial asset) or interest expense (financial liability) over the term of the instrument and is equivalent to the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the instrument to its to the net carrying amount. Revisions to expected future net cash flows that result in adjustment to the carrying amount, and any gains or losses from derecognition, are recognised in profit or loss.

Derecognition occurs in the case of a financial asset where the contractual rights to the receipt of cashflows expire or are transferred to a third party with no significant continuing involvement.

For a financial liability, derecognition occurs when the related obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.

### **Impairment**

At the end of each reporting period, an assessment is made as to the extent of any expected credit losses (ECLs) impacting on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. Expected credit losses may arise where there are indications that the counterparty is experiencing significant financial difficulty or might enter insolvency proceedings or other financial reorganisation, where there has been a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, or where changes in economic conditions have occurred impacting on the likelihood of defaults.

Under AASB 9 *Financial Instruments,* a separate allowance account is used to record any expected credit losses on financial assets (including receivables). For financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, any expected credit losses reduce the carrying amount of the asset directly.

### **(j) Interests in Joint Operations**

The Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been included in the appropriate line items of the consolidated financial statements.

### **(k) Share Capital and Reserves**

Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the fair value of consideration received. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new equity instruments are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.

Separate reserves in shareholders' equity are utilised to record the consideration received for options issued, the fair value of options or performance rights issued for no consideration that has been recognised as a share-based payments expense, and for the cumulative foreign exchange translation difference on controlled entities with a non-Australian dollar functional currency (refer Note 26(n)).

If the Company reacquires its own equity instruments, e.g., as the result of share buy-back, those instruments are deducted from equity and the associated shares are cancelled. No gain or loss is recognised in the profit or loss and the consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental costs is recognised directly in equity.

In the case of an in-specie distribution, where an asset of the Group other than cash is distributed to shareholders, the share capital of the Group is reduced by the fair value relevant asset.

### **(l) Share based payments**

The Group has an Employee Incentive Securities Plan, whereby Shares, Options and Performance Rights may be issued in return for services. Share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the instruments issued and recognised in profit or loss as share-based payments expense over the relevant vesting periods. Share based payments to non-employees are measured at the fair value of goods or services received if they can be reliably measured, otherwise at the fair value of the equity instruments issued. The fair value is recognised when the goods or services are received. A corresponding amount to the share-based payments expense or amount recognised for goods or services received is recorded in the share-based payment reserve in equity.

When shares are issued following the exercise of an option, or the vesting of a performance right, a transfer is made from the share-based payment reserve to issued capital for the amount related to those particular options or rights. When an option or performance right expires or lapses, a transfer is made from the share-based payment reserve to retained earnings.

The fair value of unlisted options is determined using an option pricing model, such as the Black–Scholes model. Performance rights are valued with reference to the Company's share price at the grant date. Market-based vesting conditions are factored into the grant date fair value, typically using a probability assessment. The number of options and performance rights expected to vest is reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting period such that the cumulative amount recognised for services received as

{57}------------------------------------------------

consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vests.

### **(m) Earnings per share**

### (i) Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year.

### (ii) Diluted earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after, income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

### **(n) Foreign Currency Transactions and Balances**

### **Functional and presentation currency**

The functional currency of each of the Group's entities is based on the primary economic environment in which that entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars which is the parent entity's functional currency.

### **Transaction and balances**

Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost continue to be carried at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss, except where deferred in equity as a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge.

### **Group companies**

The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the Group's presentation currency are translated as follows:

- assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period; and
- income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period.

Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations with functional currencies other than Australian dollars are recognised in other comprehensive income and included in the foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of financial position. The cumulative amount of these differences is reclassified into profit or loss in the period in which the operation is disposed of.

### **(o) Employee Benefits**

Provision is made for the Group's liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees to the end of the reporting period. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have been measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled.

Employee benefits payable later than one year have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee wage increases and the probability that the employee may satisfy any vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted using market yields on corporate bonds with terms to maturity that match the expected timing of cash flows attributable to employee benefits.

### **(p) Site Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Provision**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, the future sacrifice of economic benefits is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.

Provision is made for the restoration and environmental rehabilitation of operating sites. The provision is based on the estimated future costs, determined on a discounted basis, which are re-assessed regularly and exclude any allowance for potential changes in technology or material changes in legislative requirements. The rate used to discount future estimated costs reflects a market assessment of the time value of money adjusted for risks specific to the obligation.

### **(q) Leases**

A lease liability and a right of use asset is recognised in the statement of financial position for all leases conveying a right to control the use of an underlying asset with the exception of leases with a period of 12 months or less and for low value leases. The asset and liability are initially recognised based on discounted future lease payments and the rate embedded in the lease.

### **(r) Going Concern**

The Directors have prepared the financial report on the going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of normal business activity and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.

### **(s) Comparative Figures**

In certain cases, including when required by Australian Accounting Standards, comparative figures are adjusted to conform to the changes in recognition or presentation made in the current financial year.
