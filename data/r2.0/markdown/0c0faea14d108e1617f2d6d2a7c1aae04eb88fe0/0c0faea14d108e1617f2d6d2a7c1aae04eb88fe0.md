The Directors of Odyssey Gold Limited present their report on the Group consisting of Odyssey Gold Limited ("Company" or "Odyssey" or "Parent Entity") and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year ended 30 June 2022 ("Group").

## **OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW**

## **Operations**

Odyssey is a Western Australian gold explorer with a land position of over 170km2 in the prolific Murchison Goldfields. The Murchison Goldfields are host to a +35Moz gold endowment. Odyssey holds an 80% interest in the Tuckanarra and Stakewell gold projects (together, the "Tuckanarra Project" or "Project").

Five shallow oxide pits were mined on the Tuckanarra Project in the 1990's producing 52.9koz at an average grade of 3.4g/t gold. Additionally, approximately 29koz were produced at an average grade of 5.5g/t gold from the only modern underground mine on the Projects. The Project is located between Meekatharra and Mount Magnet, proximal to multiple gold processing plants, along the Great Northern Highway.

Previous resource development and open pit mining was focused on laterite and oxide mineralisation due to low gold prices. Odyssey has recognised the potential for significant strike and plunge extensions to the mineralisation. Drilling during 2021 demonstrated mineralisation along 1.6km of strike at the Cable Bollard Trend and more recently a new structure at the Highway Zone.

Odyssey's strategy is to continue to rapidly define high grade shoots on the Highway Zone structure, in addition to the 300m long shoot already identified, with reverse circulation ("RC") and diamond core ("DD") drilling.

(Continued)

#### **OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)**

#### **Highlights**

The Company successfully completed the 2022 drill program, with more strong results (Figure 2) delivered from both RC and DD drilling across the Tuckanarra Project. A total of 131 holes (23,131m) of RC, 15 holes (3,649m) of DD, and 11 holes (3,152) with RC pre-collars and DD tails were also completed during the period.

The results continue to demonstrate the potential near-term open pit development scenarios and future underground mining potential of the Tuckanarra Project. The future development of targets will be aided by the majority being located on granted mining leases, prior baseline environmental studies, and production records. Metallurgical recovery testwork, with favourable results are documented for all the advanced targets.

#### *Highway Zone*

- Drilling has defined high grade mineralisation at the Highway Zone. Significant assays from this target reported during the year include:
	- o 84m @ 2.5g/t Au from 25m
	- o 11m @ 7.8g/t Au from 199m
	- o 13m @ 3.7g/t Au from 180m
	- o 16m @ 3.3g/t Au from 184m
- The Highway Zone, which was first recognised in late 2021, continues to be the priority advanced target as we see clear potential to grow the open pit and underground mining potential with additional drilling.

#### *Cable-Bollard*

- Significant assays from the Cable Bollard Trend reported during the year include:
	- o 16.6m @ 16.2g/t Au from 56m
	- o 12m @ 4.7g/t Au from 128.5m
	- o 14m @ 2.4g/t Au from 115m
	- o 11m @ 4.6g/t Au from 167m
- Drilling demonstrates continuity of gold grades at depth in the Bollard and Cable Pits, with 150m of continuous mineralisation observed on the Cable East structures.
- Drilling has defined a numerous >25 gram metres (length x grade) on a shallow plunging shoot for 500m to the south of the Cable Pit, and a high grade shoot recognised below the Bollard Pit.

#### *Bottle Dump*

- Significant assays from Bottle Dump reported during the year include:
	- o 14m @ 8.2g/t Au from 95m
	- o 3.6m @ 10.0g/t Au from 225m
- Drilling by Odyssey over the last 18 months has successfully defined the mineralisation from the base of the pit to over 360m down plunge and over 240m below surface.
- Notably the result of 14m @ 8.2g/t is only 28m below the Bottle Dump pit and located up dip of a previous hole TCKRC0004, drilled in March 2021, which returned 16m @ 2.3g/t Au.

#### *Maybelle and Anchor*

- Significant assays from Bottle Dump reported during the year include:
	- o 4m @ 53.9g/t Au from 124m
	- o 8m @ 3.9 g/t Au from 80m
	- o 8m @ 6.2 g/t Au from 60m
- The southern high grade shoot under the Maybelle Pit is not closed off to the north and will be the target of a follow-up RC drilling campaign.

#### *The Highway Zone*

Historical drilling at the Highway Zone intercepted 20.0m @ 5.7g/t Au (TPH0238), 3.0m @ 9.3g/t Au (TPH0134) and 3.0m @ 4.1g/t Au (TPH0223) at shallow depths. Odyssey first drilled the Highway Zone in late 2021, with the maiden hole intercepting 12.0m @ 6.5g/t Au from 132m in TCKRC0100 interpreted to be down dip of the historical intercepts.

Subsequent drilling has defined a significant new mineralised structure 150m to the East of the Bollard Pit. The structure is currently drilled for 480m and is open along strike. A mineralised shoot 300m long, >10m wide true width, 2-9g/t Au has been defined in RC drilling (Figure 3). The deepest hole intersected mineralisation continuing at 200m below surface (Figure 4). Wide intersections in oxide and, 5 of 8 RC holes containing intervals of over 5g/t Au in the mineralised shoot, give strong encouragement for the potential for both open pit and underground development in the future.

The favourable lithology may extend for a further 800m to the northeast (Figure 5) based on historical workings, the interpretation of airborne magnetics, and historical mapping. The Highway Zone is the highest priority advanced target on the Tuckanarra Project.

## **OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)**

#### **Drilling (continued)**

#### *Cable-Bollard*

The Company completed 89 RC holes for 17,485m and 13 DD holes for 2,980m at Cable-Bollard, for a total of 6,940m.

The Cable-Bollard Trend comprises multiple parallel gold bearing structures. The mineralisation is hosted in sheared laminated quartz veins or sulphides associated with banded iron formation ("BIF") units, within mafic intrusives and metavolcanics, and highly silicified ultramafics. Infrequent felsic dykes crosscut the mineralisation.

The Cable-Bollard Trend extends for over 1.6km of strike with deepest drilling to a vertical depth of 150m. The project has significant growth potential, with the favourable lithology and historic workings. Drilling along the Cable-Bollard Trend has identified the 500m of strike length immediately below the 35m deep Cable Pit, and to the south to the south of the Cable Pit as one of several significant shoots on the Tuckanarra Project. Similarly, a high grade shoot was intersected in several holes beneath the Bollard Pit (Figure 7). This shoot will be a focus of future drilling and underground mining evaluation.

During the period, a number of high-grade infill and extensional gold intercepts were returned from drilling including:

- **11m @ 4.6g/t Au from 167m** (TCKRC0104)
- 
- **12.4m@ 4.7g/t Au from 128.5m** (CBDD0010) ▪ **20m @ 2.2g/t Au from 124m** (CBRC0047)

Bottle Dump is BIF hosted mineralisation located approximately 3km to the south-east of Cable-Bollard. A shallow oxide pit was mined in 1990's. Drilling by Odyssey has delineated along 600m of strike and up to ~250m down dip. The mineralisation is open along strike to the east and north-west, and down dip and down plunge to the southeast.

The Bottle Dump Shear Zone has the strong potential to host significant gold mineralisation due to its east-southeast ("ESE") trending BIF sequences being subparallel to interpreted ESE trending major shears.

During the period, assay results for 19 drill holes were received including notable results of:

- **3.6m @ 10.0g/t Au from 225m** (TCKDD0064)
- **1.3m @ 8.0g/t Au from 219m** (TCKRCD0076)

*Bottle Dump (continued)*

![](_page_9_Figure_5.jpeg)

*Figure 8 - Bottle Dump plan showing H2 FY2022 RC drill results.*

High-grade gold intercepts from the last round of drilling at Bottle Dump show the potential for the continuation of gold mineralisation down dip, down plunge towards the south-east (Figure 8).

Parts of the Bottle Dump mineralisation remain open up dip. Additional shoots are likely to occur along strike to the east, or on parallel structures to the north and south of Bottle Dump.

#### *Maybelle and Lucknow Trends*

Gold mineralisation at Maybelle is associated with steeply dipping sheared sediments that extend for over 1.5km along a line of historical workings. A shallow oxide pit, on the southern 450m of sediment, was predominantly mined in the mid 1990's.

Historic drilling at Maybelle was typically less than 60m in depth. Prior to the recent drilling campaign, only one hole was drilled deeper than 100m below surface. Mining was to a maximum of 26m below surface.

Ore treated from mining at Maybelle up to 1904 is reported as ~554t @ 5.7g/t Au for 103oz produced. Subsequent open pit mining to a depth of ~30m in the early 1990's produced 52kt @ 3.6g/t Au for 6,020oz before mining was halted as the ore started to transition to primary sulphides. Metallurgical test work completed in 1994 on composites from fresh sulphide mineralisation recovered over 98% of gold in fresh rock.

RC drilling completed during the period demonstrated the continuity of multiple shoots down dip of shallow oxide mineralisation along 1.5km of strike of the Maybelle Trend. The RC program was completed on an 80x40m spacing down plunge of the historic rotary air blast ("RAB") and shallow RC drilling. A total of 28 RC holes for 3,645m was completed. The most notable is a result of 4m @ 53g/t Au. This hole confirms a steeper plunge of the mineralisation shoots, over 100m of vertical continuity of mineralisation (Figure 10), and the potential for higher grade mineralisation that can be considered for underground evaluation following additional positive drilling results.

## **Mapping**

The Company continued detailed field mapping around Anchor and east of the Cable-Bollard Trend. The total area mapped in detail by Odyssey increased to approximately 6.4km2.

The detailed field mapping, once integrated with the geochemical and geophysical surveys, will serve as part of an exploration model that will significantly increase the geological understanding of the area.

During the process of mapping samples were collected of historic RAB and aircore drill spoils (156 samples), and rock chip/grab samples (111) of outcrop of interest.

## **Soil Geochemistry**

Odyssey continued a detailed soil sampling program at the Tuckanarra Project. A total of 1,535 samples were collected during the period. Results confirmed relatively continuous >10ppb soil anomalism extending from the northern end of the Cable-Bollard Trend to west of the Bottle Dump Pit.

Substantial progress has been made on the classification of drillhole and spoil XRF data with semi-supervised machine learning. All XRF data is now classified using the machine learning algorithm to provide higher confidence in lithology data. 35,537 XRF readings have been collected and classified by the Company.

## **Future Work**

Drilling during the reporting period has highlighted the potential of the Highway Zone to be a significant area of new mineralisation on the Tuckanarra Project. Over 50% of holes intersected 25 gram metres or more along the 400m of strike the structure is defined. High grades and wide intersections give strong encouragement for future open pit and underground mining potential at the Highway Zone. The structure remains open along strike and down plunge. RC drilling the strike extensions will be the focus of drilling in FY2023.

The company has a portfolio of advanced targets with shallow oxide mineralisation and emerging high grade shoots. The inventory growth on the Tuckanarra Project is in a district of mining companies with, cumulatively, 7.5Mtpa of processing capacity during a period of extended strong gold price.

Additionally, preparation is underway for RAB drilling planned to drill the Greenstone Target and Regal Target (Figure 15). The Greenstone Target comprises 8km of antiformal basalts and dolerite adjacent to the flexure of a regional fault. This favourable structural setting in known hosts of high-grade gold mineralisation makes the Greenstone Target a high priority for RAB drilling. The Greenstone Target has not previously been bedrock drilled.

The Regal Target contains a large number of historic workings on the continuation of the Maybelle Trend. Very sparse RAB drilling has occurred in the area and no RC or diamond drilling is known.

#### **COVID-19**

The outbreak of the 2019 novel strain of coronavirus causing a contagious respiratory disease known as COVID-19, and the subsequent quarantine measures imposed by the Australian and other governments, and related travel and trade restrictions have caused disruption to businesses and resulted in significant global economic impacts. As at 30 June 2022, these impacts have not had a significant effect on the Group's financial results or operations. However, as the impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve, including changes in government policy and business reactions thereto, if our staff are unable to work or travel due to illness or government restrictions, we may be forced to reduce or suspend our exploration and development activities. In addition, as the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have also negatively impacted global economic conditions, this, in turn, could adversely affect our business in the future. Due to the continually evolving nature of COVID-19 the Directors cannot reasonably estimate the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on future periods and believes that any disturbance may be temporary. However, there is uncertainty about the length and potential impact of any resultant disturbance. As a result, we are unable to estimate the potential impact on the Group's future operations as at the date of these Financial Statements.

#### **Corporate**

During the year, the Company appointed highly respected gold geologist, Mr Matthew Briggs, as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of the Company, effective from 17 January 2022. Mr Briggs is an expert and experienced professional exploration geologist with an ideal background in gold exploration and mining in Australia, most recently as Managing Director of Tanami gold explorer, Prodigy Gold Ltd.

Financial Statements.

**Corporate**

**14**

The net loss of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2022 was \$9,538,268 (2021: loss of \$4,372,043). This loss is predominately comprised of exploration and evaluation expenditure of \$8,282,758 (2021: \$3,049,705) and is attributable to the Group's accounting policy of expensing exploration and evaluation expenditure (other than expenditures incurred in the acquisition of the rights to explore) incurred by the Group.

#### **Financial Position**

The Group had cash reserves of \$3,480,120 at 30 June 2022 (2021: \$12,689,470) and no debt. At 30 June 2022, the Group had net assets of \$9,977,771 (2021: \$19,270,545), a decrease of 48% compared with the previous year driven predominately by the loss for the financial year. As at 30 June 2022, the Company had a net current asset surplus of \$877,909 (2021: \$11,282,642).

## **Environmental Regulation and Performance**

The Group's operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations under the relevant government's legislation. Full compliance with these laws and regulations is regarded as a minimum standard for all operations to achieve.

Instances of environmental non-compliance by an operation are identified either by external compliance audits or inspections by relevant government authorities. There have been no significant known breaches by the Group during the financial year.

## **Principal Activities**

The principal activities of the Group during the year consisted of the exploration and development of mineral resource projects in Western Australia.

#### **Business Strategies and Prospects for Future Financial Years**

The objective of the Group is to create long-term shareholder value through the acquisition and development of technically and economically viable mineral deposits.

To date, the Group has not commenced production of any minerals, nor has it identified a Mineral Resource in accordance with the JORC Code. To achieve its objective, the Group currently intends over the medium term to conduct further exploration activities including field work to follow up targets identified at the Tuckanarra and Stakewell Gold Projects.

These activities are inherently risky and the Board is unable to provide certainty of the expected results of these activities, or that any or all of these likely developments will be achieved.

The material business risks faced by the Group that could have an effect on the Group's future prospects, and how the Group manages these risks include:

- **The Group's exploration programmes may not identify an economic deposit -** The Group's Projects are at an early stage of exploration and current/potential investors should understand that mineral exploration, development and mining are high-risk enterprises, only occasionally providing high rewards. The success of the Group depends, among other things, on successful exploration and/or acquisition of reserves, securing and maintaining title to tenements and consents, successful design, construction, commissioning and operating of mining and processing facilities, successful development and production in accordance with forecasts and successful management of the operations. Exploration and mining activities may also be hampered by force majeure circumstances, land claims and unforeseen mining problems. There is no assurance that exploration and development of the mineral interests owned by the Group, or any other projects that may be acquired in the future, will result in the discovery of mineral deposits which are capable of being exploited economically. Even if an apparently viable deposit is identified, there is no guarantee that it can be profitably exploited. If such commercial viability is never attained, the Group may seek to transfer its property interests or otherwise realise value, or the Group may even be required to abandon its business and fail as a "going concern";

## **OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)**

## **Business Strategies and Prospects for Future Financial Years (continued)**

- **The Group's exploration activities being delayed due to lack of available equipment and services -** The exploration activities of the Group requires the involvement of a number of third parties, including drilling contractors, assay laboratories, consultants, other contractors and suppliers. Demand for drilling equipment and exploration related services in Western Australia is currently very high and has resulted in higher exploration costs, delays in completing the Group's exploration activities, and delays in the assessment and reporting of the results. Should there continue to be high demand for exploration equipment and related services, there may be further delays in undertaking exploration activities, which may result in increased exploration costs and/or increased working capital requirements for the Group and may have a material impact on the Group's operations and performance;
- **The Group's operations will require further capital** the exploration and any development of the Group's exploration properties will require substantial additional financing. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in delaying, or the indefinite postponement of, exploration and any development of the Group's properties or even a loss of property interest. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available if needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favourable to the Group;
- **The Group may be adversely affected by fluctuations in commodity prices**  the price of commodities fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the control of the Group. Future production, if any, from the Group's mineral properties will be dependent upon the price of commodities being adequate to make these properties economic. The Group currently does not engage in any hedging or derivative transactions to manage commodity price risk. As the Group's operations change, this policy will be reviewed periodically going forward; and
- **Global financial conditions may adversely affect the Group's growth and profitability** many industries, including the mineral resource industry, are impacted by these market conditions. Some of the key impacts include contraction in credit markets resulting in a widening of credit risk, devaluations and high volatility in global equity, commodity, foreign exchange and precious metal markets, and a lack of market liquidity. Due to the current nature of the Group's activities, a slowdown in the financial markets or other economic conditions may adversely affect the Group's growth and ability to finance its activities.

The remuneration policy for the Group's KMP has been developed by the Board taking into account:

- the size of the Group;
- the size of the management team for the Group;
- the nature and stage of development of the Group's current operations; and
- market conditions and comparable salary levels for companies of a similar size and operating in similar sectors.

In addition to considering the above general factors, the Board has also placed emphasis on the following specific issues in determining the remuneration policy for KMP:

- the Group is currently focused on identifying new business projects, and undertaking exploration and development activities;
- risks associated with small cap resource companies whilst acquiring, exploring and developing projects; and
- other than profit which may be generated from asset sales, the Group does not expect to be undertaking profitable operations until sometime after the successful commercialisation, production and sales of commodities from one or more of its projects, or the acquisition of a profitable project.

#### **Executive Remuneration**

The Group's remuneration policy is to provide executives a fixed remuneration component and a performance based component (including incentive and/or performance based securities, see below). The Board believes that this remuneration policy is appropriate given the considerations discussed in the section above and is appropriate in aligning KMP objectives with shareholder and business objectives.

#### *Fixed Remuneration*

Fixed remuneration consists of base salary, as well as employer contributions to superannuation funds and other non-cash benefits.

Fixed remuneration is reviewed annually by the Board (if applicable). The process consists of a review of company and individual performance, relevant comparative remuneration externally and internally and, where appropriate, external advice on policies and practices.

#### *Performance Based Remuneration – Short Term Incentive ("STI")*

Some executives may be entitled to an annual cash bonus upon achieving various key performance indicators ("KPI's"), as set by the Board. Having regard to the current size, nature and opportunities of the Group, the Board has determined that these KPI's will include measures such as:

- successful exploration activities (e.g. completion of exploration programs within budgeted timeframes and costs);
- successful development activities (e.g. completion of technical studies);
- successful corporate activities (e.g. recruitment and management of key personnel and investor relations activities); and
- successful business development activities (e.g. corporate transactions and capital raisings).

{23}------------------------------------------------

(Continued)

## **REMUNERATION REPORT – AUDITED (Continued)**

#### **Executive Remuneration (Continued)**

These measures were chosen as the Board believes these represent the key drivers in the short and medium term success of the Group's development. On an annual basis, subsequent to year end, the Board assesses performance against each individual executive's KPI criteria and considers the position of the Group to be able to award STI cash bonuses.

During the 2022 financial year, no STI cash bonuses were awarded to KMP (2021: nil).

#### *Performance Based Remuneration – Long Term Incentive Plan*

The Group has a long-term equity incentive plan ("Incentive Plan") comprising the grant of Performance Rights and/or Incentive Options to reward KMP and key employees and contractors for long-term performance. To achieve its corporate objectives, the Group needs to attract, incentivise, and retain its key employees and contractors. The Board believes that grants of Performance Rights and/or Incentive Options to KMP will provide a useful tool to underpin the Group's employment and engagement strategy.

#### (i) Performance Rights

The Group has an Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance of unlisted performance share rights ("Performance Rights") which, upon satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions attached to the Performance Rights, will result in the issue of an Ordinary Share for each Performance Right. Performance Rights are issued for no consideration and no amount is payable upon conversion thereof.

The Incentive Plan enables the Group to: (a) recruit, incentivise and retain KMP and other key employees and contractors needed to achieve the Group's business objectives; (b) link the reward of key staff with the achievement of strategic goals and the long-term performance of the Group; (c) align the financial interest of participants of the Plan with those of Shareholders; and (d) provide incentives to participants of the Incentive Plan to focus on superior performance that creates Shareholder value.

Performance Rights granted under the Incentive Plan to eligible participants will be linked to the achievement by the Group of certain performance conditions as determined by the Board from time to time. These performance conditions must be satisfied in order for the Performance Rights to vest. Upon Performance Rights vesting, Ordinary Shares are automatically issued for no consideration. If a performance condition of a Performance Right is not achieved by the expiry date then the Performance Right will lapse.

During the financial year ended 30 June 2022, 8,400,000 Performance Rights were granted to KMP (2021: nil). No Performance Rights held by KMP lapsed during the financial year nor did any convert into ordinary shares.

#### (ii) Incentive Options

The Group has an Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance of unlisted incentive options ("Incentive Options") as part of remuneration and incentive arrangements in order to attract and retain services and to provide an incentive linked to the performance of the Group. The Board's policy is to grant Incentive Options to KMP with exercise prices at or above market share price (at the time of agreement). As such, the Incentive Options granted to KMP are generally only of benefit if the KMP performs to the level whereby the value of the Group increases sufficiently to warrant exercising the Incentive Options granted. Other than service-based vesting conditions (if any) and the exercise price required to exercise the Incentive Options, there are no additional performance criteria on the Incentive Options granted to KMP, as given the speculative nature of the Group's activities and the small management team responsible for its running, it is considered that the performance of the KMP and the performance and value of the Group are closely related. The Company's Securities Trading Policy prohibits KMP's from entering into arrangements to limit their exposure to Incentive Securities granted as part of their remuneration package.

During the financial year ended 30 June 2022, 2,000,000 Incentive Options were granted to KMP (2021: 27,000,000). No Incentive Options held by KMP expired during the financial year nor were any exercised into ordinary shares.

During the financial year ended 30 June 2022, 2,000,000 Incentive Options were granted to KMP (2021: 27,000,000). No Incentive Options held by KMP expired during the financial year nor were any exercised into

The Board's policy is to remunerate Non-Executive Directors at market rates for comparable companies for time, commitment and responsibilities. Given the current size, nature and risks of the Group, incentive securities have been used to attract and retain Non-Executive Directors. The Board determines payments to the Non-Executive Directors and reviews their remuneration annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice is sought when required.

The maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to Non-Executive Directors is subject to approval by shareholders at a General Meeting. Total directors' fees paid to all non-executive directors are not to exceed \$150,000 per annum. Director's fees paid to Non-Executive Directors accrue on a daily basis. Fees for Non-Executive Directors are not linked to the performance of the economic entity. However, to align Directors' interests with shareholder interests, the Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company and Non-Executive Directors may in limited circumstances receive incentive securities in order to secure their services.

Fees for the Chairman are presently \$36,000 per annum (2021: \$36,000) and fees for other Non-Executive Directors are presently \$25,000 (2021: \$20,000-\$36,000). These fees cover main board activities only. Non-Executive Directors may receive additional remuneration for other services provided to the Group, including but not limited to, membership of committees.

#### **Relationship between Remuneration of KMP and Shareholder Wealth**

During the Group's project identification, acquisition, exploration and development phases of its business, the Board anticipates that the Group will retain earnings (if any) and other cash resources for the exploration and development of its resource projects. Accordingly the Group does not currently have a policy with respect to the payment of dividends and returns of capital. Therefore there is no relationship between the Board's policy for determining the nature and amount of remuneration of KMP and dividends paid and returns of capital by the Group during the current and previous four financial years.

The Board did not determine the nature and amount of remuneration of the KMP by reference to changes in the price at which shares in the Group traded between the beginning and end of the current financial year. Discretionary annual cash bonuses, when applicable, will be based on achieving various non-financial key performance indicators to be determined by the Board. However, as noted above, KMP's may receive Incentive Securities which generally will only be of value should the value of the Company's shares increase sufficiently to warrant exercising the Incentive Securities.

#### **Relationship between Remuneration of KMP and Earnings**

As discussed above, the Group is currently undertaking new project acquisition, exploration and development activities, and does not expect to be undertaking profitable operations (other than by way of material asset sales, none of which is currently planned) until sometime after the successful commercialisation, production and sales of commodities from one or more of its projects. Accordingly the Board does not consider earnings during the current and previous four financial years when determining the nature and amount of remuneration of KMP.

There were no incentive securities that lapsed for any KMP of the Company during the 2022 and 2021 financial years.

The fair value of Performance Rights is estimated as at the date of grant using the closing share price of the Company on such date. The fair value of Incentive Options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the Incentive Options were granted. The table below lists the inputs to the valuation model used for share options granted by the Company to the KMP in the previous table:

| Inputs                   | Series 1 | Series 2 |
|--------------------------|----------|----------|
| Exercise price           | A\$0.10  | A\$0.15  |
| Grant date share price   | A\$0.069 | A\$0.069 |
| Dividend yield1          | -        | -        |
| Volatility               | 130%     | 130%     |
| Risk-free interest rate  | 0.903%   | 0.903%   |
| Grant date               | 7-Dec-21 | 7-Dec-21 |
| Expiry date              | 8-Dec-24 | 8-Dec-24 |
| Expected life of option2 | 3 years  | 3 years  |
| Fair value at grant date | A\$0.048 | A\$0.044 |

**Notes:**

1 The dividend yield reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout will remain unchanged.

2 The expected life of the options is based on the expiry date of the options.

## FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

#### **1. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The principal and significant accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial report of the Company, Odyssey Gold Limited and its consolidated entities ("Group") for the year ended 30 June 2022 are stated to assist in a general understanding of the financial report.

Odyssey Gold Limited is a company limited by shares incorporated in Australia whose shares are quoted on the Australian Securities Exchange. The financial report of the Company for the year ended 30 June 2022 was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 20 September 2022.

#### **(a) Basis of Preparation**

The financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards ("AASBs") and interpretations adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ("AASB") and the Corporations Act 2001. The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of the Group. For the purposes of preparing the consolidated statements, the Company is a for-profit entity. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the continuity of normal business activity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial report has also been prepared on a historical cost basis.

The financial report is presented in Australian dollars.

#### **(b) Going Concern**

This consolidated financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

The Group has incurred a loss after tax of \$9,538,268 (2021: \$4,372,043) and had net cash outflows from operating and investing activities of \$9,165,046 (2021: \$7,611,009). The Group has no source of cash inflows other than interest income and funds sourced through capital raising activities. At 30 June 2022, the Group has cash and cash equivalents totalling \$3,480,120 (30 June 2021: \$12,689,470) and net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of \$877,909 (30 June 2021: \$11,282,642).

The Group's cashflow forecast for the period ending 30 September 2023 reflects that the Group will be required to raise additional working capital. The Directors consider the Group a going concern and acknowledge that discretionary expenditure will be monitored and managed in line with available funds until such time as additional capital raising activities are completed.

After year end, the Company announced that it will undertake a non-renounceable entitlements offer ("Entitlements Offer") to raise up to \$4.6 million before costs. Under the Entitlements Offer, eligible shareholders will be offered the opportunity to purchase one (1) new fully paid ordinary share in the Company ("New Shares") for every four (4) fully paid ordinary shares held at the record date, at an issue price of \$0.03 per New Share. The Directors and Officers of the Company have agreed to take up their full entitlements under the Entitlement Offer and also agreed to partially underwrite the Entitlement Offer by applying for shortfall shares, up to a combined amount of approximately \$0.9 million.

Accordingly, the Directors believe that the Group will be able to obtain sufficient funding to enable it to continue as a going concern and that it is appropriate to adopt that basis in the preparation of the financial report. However, there is a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt as to whether it will be able to continue as a going concern and therefore, whether it will realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or to the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern.

#### **(c) Statement of Compliance**

The financial report complies with Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

In the current financial year, the Group has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current annual reporting period however these have resulted in no impact on the financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 30 June 2022.

The Group has incurred a loss after tax of \$9,538,268 (2021: \$4,372,043) and had net cash outflows from operating and investing activities of \$9,165,046 (2021: \$7,611,009). The Group has no source of cash inflows other than interest income and funds sourced through capital raising activities. At 30 June 2022, the Group has cash and cash equivalents totalling \$3,480,120 (30 June 2021: \$12,689,470) and net working capital (current assets less current

The Group's cashflow forecast for the period ending 30 September 2023 reflects that the Group will be required to raise additional working capital. The Directors consider the Group a going concern and acknowledge that discretionary expenditure will be monitored and managed in line with available funds until such time as additional

After year end, the Company announced that it will undertake a non-renounceable entitlements offer ("Entitlements Offer") to raise up to \$4.6 million before costs. Under the Entitlements Offer, eligible shareholders will be offered the opportunity to purchase one (1) new fully paid ordinary share in the Company ("New Shares") for every four (4) fully paid ordinary shares held at the record date, at an issue price of \$0.03 per New Share. The Directors and Officers of the Company have agreed to take up their full entitlements under the Entitlement Offer and also agreed to partially underwrite the Entitlement Offer by applying for shortfall shares, up to a combined amount of

Accordingly, the Directors believe that the Group will be able to obtain sufficient funding to enable it to continue as a going concern and that it is appropriate to adopt that basis in the preparation of the financial report. However, there is a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt as to whether it will be able to continue as a going concern and therefore, whether it will realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or to the amounts

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Odyssey Gold Limited ("Company" or "Parent Entity") as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. Odyssey Gold Limited and its subsidiaries together are referred to as the Group.

Control is only achieved when the Group has the power over the investee (i.e. ability to direct relevant activities of the investee), is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and when it has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. When the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over the investee, including the size of the Group's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders, the potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties and any rights arising from other contractual arrangements.

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions and balances, income and expenses and profits and losses between Group companies, are eliminated. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Entity, using consistent accounting policies. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment in the individual financial statements of the Company.

#### **(f) Earnings per Share (EPS)**

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit/loss attributable to equity holders of the Company, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the year. Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

#### **(g) Cash and Cash Equivalents**

"Cash and cash equivalents" includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions and other shortterm highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined.

#### **1. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

#### **(h) Operating Segments**

An operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity), whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available. This includes start up operations which are yet to earn revenues. Management will also consider other factors in determining operating segments such as the existence of a line manager and the level of segment information presented to the board of directors.

Operating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision makers – being the Board of Directors. The group aggregates two or more operating segments when they have similar economic characteristics, and the segments are similar in each of the following respects:

- Nature of the products and services,
- Nature of the production processes,
- Type or class of customer for the products and services,
- Methods used to distribute the products or provide the services, and if applicable,
- Nature of the regulatory environment.

Operating segments that meet the quantitative criteria as prescribed by AASB 8 are reported separately. However, an operating segment that does not meet the quantitative criteria is still reported separately where information about the segment would be useful to users of the financial statements. Information about other business activities and operating segments that are below the quantitative criteria are combined and disclosed in a separate category for "all other segments".

#### **(i) Other Income Recognition**

Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument) to the net carrying value amount of the financial asset.

#### **(j) Income Tax**

The income tax expense for the year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income based on the national income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted for each jurisdiction. The relevant tax rates are applied to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is made for certain temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability. No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in relation to these temporary differences if they arose on goodwill or in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in controlled entities where the Parent Entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Current and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against tax liabilities and the deferred tax liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. The Parent Entity and its wholly owned Australian controlled entity have implemented the tax consolidation legislation. The head entity within the tax consolidated group is Odyssey Gold Limited.

#### **(k) Dividends**

Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on or before the end of the year but not distributed at balance date.

{38}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_38_Picture_0.jpeg)

#### **(l) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets**

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset's value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value. In such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs. When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognised in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. An assessment is also made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss. After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future years to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the profit and loss statement net of any reimbursement.

#### **(n) Trade and Other Payables**

Trade and other payables are recognised at amortised cost and represent liabilities for the goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial period that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days. Where trade and other payables are to be deferred for a period greater than 12 months, the Group discounts the amount to its present value based on the expected timing of the payment.

#### **(o) Deferred Consideration**

A liability for deferred consideration is recognised on the acquisition of an asset and is included in the acquisition cost of the asset.

#### **(p) Contingent Consideration**

The Company has recognised an amount in relation to the Contingent Cash Consideration on the Tuckanarra Project being the consideration of \$1,000,000 discounted to its present value based on the expected timing of the payment. The Company has recognised the amounts on the basis that the performance criteria on the Tuckanarra Project are more likely than not to be met within the required timeframe. This is on the basis that previous exploration activities on the Tuckanarra Project were substantially advanced leading to an increased probability that a JORC resource will be declared. The Contingent Cash Consideration has been capitalised as an acquisition cost.

#### **(q) Contributed Equity**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Issued and paid up capital is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received by the Company. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or incentive securities (classed as equity) are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

(Continued)

#### **1. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

#### **(r) Investments and Other Financial Assets**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions to the instrument. For financial assets, this is equivalent to the date that the Group commits itself to either the purchase or sale of the asset. Financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets (other than financial assets at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

#### *(i) Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets*

For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets other than those designated and effective as hedging instruments are classified into the following categories upon initial recognition:

- amortised cost
- fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)
- equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
- debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised in profit or loss are presented within other income or expenses respectively.

Classifications of financial assets are determined by both the entities business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.

#### *(ii) Loans and receivables*

Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment in accordance with *(iv) Impairment of Financial Assets* below. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate.

#### *(iii) Fair Value Estimation*

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets (other than financial assets at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt instruments held. Other techniques, such as discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.

The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

#### *(iv) Impairment of Financial Assets*

The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on receivables. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate.

For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.

Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.

**38**

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss.

On derecognition of a financial asset other than in its entirety (e.g. when the Group retains an option to repurchase part of a transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying amount of the financial asset between the part it continues to recognise under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognises on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts on the date of the transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognised and the sum of the consideration received for the part no longer recognised and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss. A cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.

#### **(s) Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure**

Expenditure on exploration and evaluation is accounted for in accordance with the 'area of interest' method. Exploration and evaluation expenditure encompasses expenditures incurred by the Group in connection with the exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable. For each area of interest, expenditure incurred in the acquisition of rights to explore is capitalised, classified as tangible or intangible, and recognised as an exploration and evaluation asset. Exploration and evaluation assets are measured at cost at recognition and are recorded as an asset if:

- the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
- at least one of the following conditions is also met:
	- o the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; and
	- o exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.

Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred by the Group subsequent to the acquisition of the rights to explore will be expensed as incurred, up until the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project has been demonstrated with a bankable feasibility study.

Capitalised exploration costs are reviewed at each reporting date to establish whether an indication of impairment exists. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the capitalised exploration costs is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years. Where a decision is made to proceed with development, accumulated expenditure is tested for impairment and transferred to development properties, and then amortised over the life of the reserves associated with the area of interest once mining operations have commenced.

Recoverability of the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas of interest.

#### **(t) Plant and Equipment**

All classes of plant and equipment are measured at cost. Where it is expected that a liability for capital gains tax will arise, this expected amount is disclosed by way of note. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all property, plant and equipment (useful lives between 2.5 to 6 years).

#### **1. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

#### **(u) Goods and Services Tax**

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position. Cash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis and the GST components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are classified as operating cash flows.

#### **(v) Share-Based Payments**

Equity-settled share-based payments are provided to officers, employees, consultants and other advisors. These share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date. Fair value is determined using an option pricing model for options and the closing share price for performance rights with nonmarket vesting conditions or a trinomial model for performance rights with market vesting conditions. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payments reserve. Equity-settled share-based payments may also be provided as consideration for the acquisition of assets. Where ordinary shares are issued and vest immediately, the transaction is recorded at fair value based on the quoted price of the ordinary shares at the date of issue. The acquisition is then recorded as an asset or expensed in accordance with accounting standards.

#### **(w) Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions**

The Directors may evaluate a group of assets that is acquired in a transaction is not a business combination in accordance with either the optional "concentration" or "substantive process" tests in AASB 3. In such cases where a transaction is not a business combination, the cost of acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable assets (including intangible assets that meet the definition of and recognition criteria for intangible assets in AASB 138) acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.

#### **(x) Joint Operations**

A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties have joint control of the arrangement and have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is contractually agreed sharing control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. When the entity undertakes its activities under joint operations, the Group as a joint operator, recognises in relation to its interest in a joint operation:

- Its assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;
- Its liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;
- Its revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operations;
- Its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and
- Its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.

The Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with the AASBs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. When the Group transacts with the joint operation in which the entity is a joint operator, the Group is considered to be conducting the transaction with the other parties of the joint operations, and gains and losses resulting from the transactions are recognised in the Group's financial statements only to the extent of other parties' interest in the joint operation.

#### **(y) Critical Accounting Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements**

In applying the Group's accounting policies, management continually evaluates judgements, estimates and assumptions based on experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have an impact on the Group. All judgements, estimates and assumptions made are believed to be reasonable based on the most current set of circumstances available to management. Actual results may differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions. In particular, information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes:

- Exploration and evaluation assets (Note 1(s));
- Share-based payments (Note 1(v)); and
- Contingent consideration (Note 1(p) and 9).

#### **2. EXPENSES**

**NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position. Cash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis and the GST components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are classified as operating cash

Equity-settled share-based payments are provided to officers, employees, consultants and other advisors. These share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date. Fair value is determined using an option pricing model for options and the closing share price for performance rights with nonmarket vesting conditions or a trinomial model for performance rights with market vesting conditions. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payments reserve. Equity-settled share-based payments may also be provided as consideration for the acquisition of assets. Where ordinary shares are issued and vest immediately, the transaction is recorded at fair value based on the quoted price of the ordinary shares at the date of issue. The acquisition is then recorded as an asset or

The Directors may evaluate a group of assets that is acquired in a transaction is not a business combination in accordance with either the optional "concentration" or "substantive process" tests in AASB 3. In such cases where a transaction is not a business combination, the cost of acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable assets (including intangible assets that meet the definition of and recognition criteria for intangible assets in AASB 138)

**Notes:**

The ordinary shares ("Shares") are ordinary shares and rank equally in all respects with all ordinary shares in the Company and have no par value. The rights attaching to the Shares arise from a combination of the Company's Constitution, statute and general law. Copies of the Company's Constitution are available for inspection during business hours at its registered office.

#### *(ii) Reports and Notices*

Shareholders are entitled to receive all notices, reports, accounts and other documents required to be furnished to shareholders under the Company's Constitution, the Corporations Act and the Listing Rules.

#### *(iii) Voting*

Subject to any rights or restrictions at the time being attached to any class or classes of shares, at a general meeting of the Company on a show of hands, every ordinary Shareholder present in person, or by proxy, attorney or representative (in the case of a company) has one vote and upon a poll, every Shareholder present in person, or by proxy, attorney or representative (in the case of a company) has one vote for any Share held by the Shareholder. A poll may be demanded by the Chairperson of the meeting, any 5 Shareholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy, attorney or representative or by any one or more Shareholders holding not less than 5% of the total voting rights of all Shareholders having the right to vote.

#### *(iv) Variation of Shares and Rights Attaching to Shares*

Shares may be converted or cancelled with member approval and the Company's share capital may be reduced in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act. Class rights attaching to a particular class of shares may be varied or cancelled with the consent in writing of holders of 75% of the shares in that class or by a special resolution of the holders of shares in that class.

#### *(v) Unmarketable Parcels*

The Company may procure the disposal of Shares where the member holds less than a marketable parcel of Shares within the meaning of the Listing Rules (being a parcel of shares with a market value of less than \$500). To invoke this procedure, the Directors must first give notice to the relevant member holding less than a marketable parcel of Shares, who may then elect not to have his or her Shares sold by notifying the Directors.

#### *(vi) Changes to the Constitution*

The Company's Constitution can only be amended by a special resolution passed by at least three quarters of the members present and voting at a general meeting of the Company. At least 28 days written notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution must be given.

#### **(c) Terms and Conditions of Performance Shares**

Performance Shares are issued based upon the following terms and conditions:

- The Performance Shareholders are not entitled to a dividend;
- The Performance Shares are not transferable;
- The Performance Shareholders shall have no right to vote, subject to the Corporations Act;
- Each Performance Share will vest and convert into one (1) Ordinary Share upon the earlier of: (a) a change of control event; or (b) delineation of an independently assessed JORC Code inferred resource of at least 200,000 ounces of gold at a minimum resource grade of 6.5g/t Au at the Stakewell Gold Project, within 30 months from completion of the Stakewell Acquisition;
- To the extent that any Performance Shares have not converted into Ordinary Shares by the applicable Expiry Date, such Performance Shares for each holder will automatically lapse and consolidate into one Performance Share and will then convert into one Ordinary Share;
- The Ordinary Shares issued on conversion of any Performance Share will rank equally with and confer rights identical with all other Ordinary Shares then on issue and application will be made by the Company to ASX for official quotation of the Ordinary Shares upon the date of conversion;
- The Company shall allot and issue Ordinary Shares immediately upon conversion of the Performance Shares for no consideration and shall record the allotment and issue in the manner required by the Corporations Act;
- The Performance Shares are unquoted. No application for quotation of the Performance Shares will be made by the Company.

At 30 June 2022, the range of exercise prices of unlisted securities on issue that had been granted as share-based payments was \$0.025 to \$0.15 (2021: \$0.025 to \$0.10).

#### **(e) Weighted Average Fair Value**

At 30 June 2022, the weighted average fair value of unlisted securities that had been granted as share-based payments in the past two financial years by the Company was \$0.0177 (2021: \$0.0132).

#### **(f) Unlisted Option and Performance Right Pricing Model**

The fair value of Unlisted Options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the Options were granted. The Group has assessed that it is not able to reliably measure the fair value of the goods and services received from the counterparty of the share-based payment transaction and thus has measured the fair value of the securities issued by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. The table below lists the inputs to the valuation model used for share options granted by the Group:

#### **20. SEGMENT INFORMATION**

AASB 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Company that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance.

The Company operates in one segment, being exploration for mineral resources and in one geographical location being Australia. This is the basis on which internal reports are provided to the Directors for assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources within the Company.

#### **21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES**

#### **(a) Overview**

The Group's principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, other receivables and trade and other payables. The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.

This note presents information about the Group's exposure to the above risks, its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the management of capital. Other than as disclosed, there have been no significant changes since the previous financial year to the exposure or management of these risks.

The Group manages its exposure to key financial risks in accordance with the Group's financial risk management policy. Key risks are monitored and reviewed as circumstances change (e.g. acquisition of a new project) and policies are revised as required. The overall objective of the Group's financial risk management policy is to support the delivery of the Group's financial targets whilst protecting future financial security.

Given the nature and size of the business and uncertainty as to the timing and amount of cash inflows and outflows, the Group does not enter into derivative transactions to mitigate the financial risks. In addition, the Group's policy is that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken for the purposes of making speculative gains. As the Group's operations change, the Directors will review this policy periodically going forward.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing the Group's financial risks as summarised below.

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company or Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. This arises principally from cash and cash equivalents, and other receivables. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The carrying amount of the Group's financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure, as represented below:

|                           | Notes | 2022      | 2021       |
|---------------------------|-------|-----------|------------|
|                           |       | \$        | \$         |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 18(b) | 3,480,120 | 12,689,470 |
| Other receivables         | 4     | 23        | 8          |
|                           |       | 3,480,143 | 12,689,478 |

The Group does not have any significant customers and accordingly does not have any significant exposure to bad or doubtful debts.

Other receivables comprise interest accrued and other miscellaneous receivables. Where possible the Group transacts only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. At 30 June 2022, none (2021: none) of the Group's receivables are past due.

With respect to credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.

#### **(c) Interest Rate Risk**

The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the cash and short-term deposits with a floating interest rate. These financial assets with variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. All other financial assets and liabilities, in the form of available-for-sale financial assets, receivables and payables, are non-interest bearing.

#### *(i) Exposure to interest rate risk*

At the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments was:

|                                        |     | 2022      | 2021       |
|----------------------------------------|-----|-----------|------------|
|                                        |     | \$        | \$         |
| Interest-bearing financial instruments |     |           |            |
| Cash at bank and on hand               | (A) | 3,480,120 | 12,689,470 |
|                                        |     | 3,480,120 | 12,689,470 |

(A) The weighted average interest rate of the total consolidated cash balance was 0.54% (2021: 0.36%).

The Group currently does not engage in any hedging or derivative transactions to manage interest rate risk.

*(ii) Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments*

A sensitivity of 20% has been selected as this is considered reasonable given the current level of both short term and long term interest rates. A 20% movement in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) equity and profit and loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2021.

|                           | Profit or loss  |                 | Equity          |                 |  |
|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--|

#### **21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Continued)**

#### **(d) Capital Management**

The Board's policy is to maintain a suitable capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Given the stage of development of the Group, the Board's objective is to minimise debt going forward and to raise funds as required through the issue of new shares. However, the Board will undertake short term borrowings to provide temporary funding where appropriate. The Group is currently examining new business opportunities where acquisition/working capital requirements of a new project may involve additional funding in some format (which may include debt, where appropriate).

There were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the year. The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

#### **(e) Fair Value**

The net fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their carrying value. The methods for estimating fair values are outlined in the relevant notes to the Financial Statements.

#### **(f) Liquidity Risk**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company and Group will not be able to meet their financial obligations as they fall due. The Board's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that the Company will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due. This is monitored by the preparation of monthly cash flow reports, and regular forecasts as required but at least every six months.

The contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments, are provided below. There are no netting arrangements in respect of financial liabilities.

|                          | Carrying<br>Amount | Contractual<br>cash flows | 6 months<br>or less | 6-12<br>months | 1-2 years | 2-5 years   |

#### Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern

We draw attention to Note 1(b) of the financial statements which indicates that the Group has incurred a loss after tax of \$9,538,268 (2021: \$4,372,043) and had net cash outflows from operating and investing activities of \$9,165,046 (2021: \$7,611,009). The Group has no source of cash inflows other than interest income and funds sourced through capital raising activities. At 30 June 2022, the Group has cash and cash equivalents totaling \$3,480,120 (30 June 2021: \$12,689,470) and net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of \$877,909 (30 June 2021: \$11,282,642). As stated in Note 1(b), these events or conditions, along with other matters set forth in Note 1(b), indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

#### Key Audit Matter

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter. In addition to the matter described in the Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern section, we have determined the matter described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

#### Other Information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the Group's annual report for the year ended 30 June 2022 but does not include the financial report and the auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

#### Other Matter

The financial report of Odyssey Gold Ltd, for the year ended 30 June 2021, was audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on that report on 24 September 2021.

#### Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of these financial statements is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at:

In addition to the ASX Corporate Governance Council's 'Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations – 4th Edition' the Board has taken into account a number of important factors in determining its corporate governance policies and procedures; including the:

- relatively simple operations of the Company, which currently only undertakes exploration and development activities;
- cost verses benefit of additional corporate governance requirements or processes;
- size of the Board;
- Board's experience in the relevant sector;
- organisational reporting structure and number of reporting functions, operational divisions and employees;
- relatively simple financial affairs with limited complexity and quantum;
- relatively small market capitalisation and economic value of the entity; and
- direct shareholder feedback.
