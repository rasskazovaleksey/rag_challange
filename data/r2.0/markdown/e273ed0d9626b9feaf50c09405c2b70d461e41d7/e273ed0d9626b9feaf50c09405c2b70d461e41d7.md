We will meet the expectations of society by building new businesses rooted in our Basic Commitment while maintaining a foundation for innovation

Taro SHIMADA Representative Executive Officer,

October 2022

President and CEO

### **What needs to be done for Toshiba to be Toshiba**

Putting our Basic Commitment, "Committed to People, Committed to the Future," into practice, we will build infrastructure that everyone can enjoy in order to help keep people's lives safe and secure and will help to achieve a sustainable future through carbon neutrality and the circular economy while working for social and environmental stability via a society connected by data. As the person responsible for leading these efforts, I would like first to discuss what needs to be valued and what needs to be done for Toshiba to truly be Toshiba.

Throughout its history, Toshiba has created many things that did not exist previously through its own ingenuity, and has provided such creation to the society. What has made this innovation possible is by bringing together a broad array of specialists and harnessing highly diverse R&D capabilities in the name of values that go beyond the mere pursuit of profit. In order to exist as a company that constantly generates the next new thing as expected by the society, we intend to build new businesses rooted in our Basic Commitment while maintaining a foundation for innovation. In this way, we will fulfill society's expectations.

Toward a sustainable future, we intend to maximize the power of data with a view to the further evolution of the digital economy. This will be based on the business assets we have built up in the infrastructure sector. Through products and services already being provided to customers, including automatic ticket gates, ETC systems, elevators, and POS systems, we have the ability to acquire large amounts of data, and we intend to connect this data and convert it into value. With regard to carbon neutrality initiatives, issues cannot be solved without data for making CO2 emissions and environmental impact transparent. While expanding our data business to enhance the value of infrastructure, we will work to achieve carbon neutrality and a circular economy.

{6}------------------------------------------------

### **Breaking down two types of rigidity to transform our business model**

Under the Toshiba Next Plan launched in FY2018, earnings improved and Toshiba became a company capable of generating profit consistently. It was an outcome of our success in materializing the low hanging fruits that can be achieved in the short term, including structural reforms and cross-functional team (CFT) activities in procurement, sales, and other areas. To continue improving earnings going forward, the key will be to convert to an asset-light business model while promoting value chain transformation, including product and design modularization, and also IT systems in which IT and digital are fully utilized for the realization of business process reforms.

In addition, while making data services business a pillar of earnings, we will raise its operating income margin to 26% toward FY2030 and use this business to generate 20% (120.0 billion yen) of the operating income out of 600.0 billion yen that we are projecting for the company overall.

To achieve this goal, there are two issues Toshiba needs to resolve: "internal rigidity" and "external rigidity." We will carry out three strategies—digital evolution (DE) to enhance services and recurring businesses, digital transformation (DX) to build platforms based on DE, and quantum transformation (QX) to create a quantum world where various platforms are connected across industries—in order to accommodate to changing society along with the further evolution of the digital economy. Promoting these strategies will not be possible without breaking through the two rigidities.

Internal rigidity is when internal organizations become siloed and do not effectively share information nor the results of improvement activities. In today's digital, service-oriented era, what was once the right business unit at the time of its inception is no longer relevant, and what actually needs to be done to serve customers became different. Separating software from hardware is the key to overcome this dilemma. Currently, the product is developed in a vertically divided organization in silos, and the software is incorporated into the hardware and provided as a part of a system. Separating software from hardware will allow to make updates and functional upgrades at the software level alone. Doing so will then enable us to add variety of applications, which will generate new services that allow customers to use functions that they only need in the amount that they want, which will enhance recurring business and enable us to fully realize DE. Furthermore, by creating software platforms and connecting them to other companies' hardware and applications, we will achieve DX that further expand our data services business. Beyond that, under QX, optimal solutions are identified from complex interplay of various platforms created under DX through quantum technology.

On the other hand, external rigidity is the challenge that Toshiba faces because Toshiba tries to do everything by itself, and unable to leverage R&D diversity and convert achievements into business value. Going forward, through collaboration with external parties, we will ensure that values of high potential technologies with a large market to be realized as quickly as possible.

{7}------------------------------------------------

### **Toshiba's market superiority in data services business**

We have enormous customer access points through providing products and services in the area of infrastructure, and this makes it possible for us to acquire data from both consumers and industry. This will be Toshiba's major market advantage in expanding data services business through DX.

For example, in businesses that start with people flow data, new services will be created by leveraging usage data on lighting, elevators, escalators, cash registers, trains, roads, and more. In businesses based on energy and CO2 data, we will harness our extremely unique position that we have from being involved at every stage of energy business, from generation to distribution, storage, and use. This will enable us to provide more advanced energy balancing function and to visualize CO2 emission in supply chains utilizing data on renewable energy output predictions and electricity demand forecasts.

In data services business, privacy and security risks related to data handling must be considered, and confident systems must be established. Based on the general assumption that the right of data that comes from people should belong to its person, and should never be used against their will, we have solicited the opinions of specialists in the law and ethics and engaged in repeated discussions over the past several years with a view to providing people-friendly services with high added value. We have developed systems to provide robust data security and proactive privacy protections that put people first, not companies, and we are promoting highly progressive initiatives ahead of other companies.

At the same time, to lay a foundation for future business development through QX, we are accelerating R&D and actual commercialization of quantum technologies. In particular, with respect to our commercial demonstration of quantum cryptography technology, we are in the top position globally and going forward plan to launch services around the world simultaneously. After that, we will promote diverse development and proposals through collaboration between industry, academia and government to create industry through quantum technology. There are no other companies with QX as a core component of their strategies. This is a major endeavor that will bring about development not only for Japan but for humanity as a whole.

### **Considering strategic alternatives for maximizing corporate value**

Toshiba is holding discussions with potential investors and sponsors as potential partners and reviewing strategic alternatives that include privatization. This process is being led by the management team but is also being overseen by the Special Committee, which is made up entirely of independent outside directors in order to eliminate arbitrariness, and on this basis we will work to ensure transparency to the full extent possible to keep from negatively affecting competition among the potential partners.

As the Representative Executive Officer, President and CEO, I am involved in these discussions and also participate as an observer on the Special Committee. In addition, it is the Board of Directors that will make the final determination based on the matters reviewed by the management team and Special Committee, and as a director I will have one vote. To maximize corporate value, we will fully consider all options, and I will faithfully carry out my mission.

{8}------------------------------------------------

### **Toward a rich future with stakeholders**

For a sustainable future, we will develop DE, DX, and QX, and in transforming our business structure so that the data services business becomes a pillar of earnings, I am asking each and every employee to take an active role in the transformation and contribute to Toshiba's future.

At the same time, to effect a change in consciousness, I am actively encouraging employees to reduce overtime work and take their paid vacation days. Without some leeway in how we work, working in a way that gives rise to innovation becomes impossible and we are prevented from receiving the various inputs required to think about new things. Going forward, working styles will be an issue that will greatly change the awareness not only of Toshiba internally but also of society as a whole, starting with our customers.

Our Basic Commitment, "Committed to People, Committed to the Future," is at once the expression of our intention to realize a sustainable society. We will work to create a rich future with all of our stakeholders as our efforts to fulfill this commitment broadly permeate society in the form of new value.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>**Message from the Chairperson of the Board of Directors**

I am Akihiro Watanabe, and I have been a member of the Board of Directors since June 2022, serving as Chairperson of the Board.

In assuming the position of Chairperson, I have received words of encouragement from many people in Japan and overseas, and I realized that Toshiba is truly a company that is loved by many people.

I used to manage an M&A advisory company listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which merged with a U.S. company and went private in November 2021. I understand that my experience in privatizing the company I founded and my 30-year career as an M&A advisor are highly valued, and this persuaded me to accept the position of Chairperson of Toshiba's Board of Directors.

My knowledge of Toshiba was limited, as I had very limited contact with the company earlier in my career. As an accountant, my impression of the company was that it was a troubled company which had suffered many scandals in recent years. However, my perception changed dramatically when I began to study the company upon accepting the Chairperson position. That is when I was touched by Toshiba's corporate philosophy, "Committed to People, Committed to the Future." I was so impressed that I got goosebumps. I don't know any other company that has such a wonderful corporate philosophy, and I was really proud that there was a Japanese company that had such an inspirational philosophy long before the words ESG and SDGs were thought up.

I feel that Toshiba's underlying strength is its employees, including those I have met at research laboratories and factories. They are all truly good and excellent people, and that they work enthusiastically for the benefit of customers and society. From my own experience, I strongly believe that the power to overcome many crises lies in the power of people. The company I founded was a venture that started out with scarce human, material, or financial resources. The only way for a venture company to survive is to maximize the capabilities of its people, and that is the job of the management. In fact, it was thanks to the efforts of our employees that we were able to overcome numerous crises that followed its formation, including the Lehman Shock, the Great East Japan Earthquake, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic. People have told me that I took a big risk by becoming Chairperson, however, I believe that Toshiba has a bright future because of its excellent corporate philosophy and talented employees.

Now that it has been a few months since I took the job, I have come to realize that Toshiba is truly a "good" company, but not a "strong" one. It has to address various challenges in order to become a stronger Toshiba. For example, Toshiba has an invaluable ecosystem in Japan in which each business monetizes the innovations of the Central Research Laboratory and uses the funds to create the next innovation. When you get down to the nitty-gritty of Toshiba's ecosystem, the current diverse business entities are giant venture funds that produce cash to generate ESG innovations. However, the scale of Toshiba has changed due to divestments made in the past. We are now at a point where we need to explore a new way to sustain this ecosystem.

That is exactly the reason why the entire Board is seeking a strategic alternative which includes privatization as one option. This is also a process that is designed to address the various challenges Toshiba currently faces to find the most suitable path forward in the best interests of all stakeholders, including shareholders. We are considering all possible alternatives, free from the influence of any particular stakeholder. The option we select must be feasible, and a strategy that allows Toshiba to grow over the medium to long term while preserving the best of Toshiba, and leads to the generation of cash flows.

In discussing corporate value, we must not forget the non-financial values of corporate philosophy and the significance of Toshiba's existence in society. It is most important that Toshiba pay close attention to intangible assets that are not recorded on the balance sheet, such as R&D, patents and human resources, and to maximize their long-term value. I believe that management must show each employee the mountain we have to climb and to lead and encourage each employee to have an image of their own personal growth and to work with excitement and dreams.

{10}------------------------------------------------

To this end, Toshiba's Board of Directors must gather all available information and draw on the wisdom of the public and its history, and make prudent business decisions in the best interests of shareholders and all other stakeholders.

Our newly formed Board is unified in its mission to create a stronger Toshiba, and operates as one team with members from diverse backgrounds bringing in their individual expertise and perspectives. All 12 board members are among the best in the world. They reflect not only diversity in nationality, gender and generation, but also have diverse experience, ranging from corporate management, corporate restructuring, extensive knowledge of fraud-related matters, to deep insight into capital markets. I am certain that the reappointed Board members, who have already had to make challenging decisions, and the new Board members will operate with a sense of unity and mutual respect. The shareholders have shown confidence in us, and we have a responsibility to act in the best interests of all stakeholders. To ensure a healthy and constructive debate among ourselves at this diverse Board, we aim to establish best boardroom practices, and strive to steadily improve its operation.

The job of the Chairperson and outside directors is to support and oversee the CEO and other managers as they work hard to create value for shareholders and stakeholders. The Board and management are completely aligned on the need to maximize Toshiba's corporate value, and see the need for radical transformation in achieving this goal. In addition to this, we are at a point in our company's history where we must address the very important topic of considering strategic alternatives.

It is no easy task to pursue the best interests of all stakeholders, including shareholders, while at the same time engaging in

sustainable management that contributes to the development of society through business. However, Toshiba has an excellent corporate philosophy, talented employees, and world-class directors. Above all, we have stakeholders who love Toshiba. At a time when we must tackle global challenges such as carbon neutrality, we must not forget that Toshiba has stakeholders beyond the existing definition of stakeholders, namely, the stakeholders of tomorrow's Earth.

As Chairperson of the Board of Directors, I am committed to serving the best interests of Toshiba and all its stakeholders, as expressed in our corporate philosophy, "Committed to People, Committed to the Future." I promise to do my utmost to support the management as it seeks to maximize Toshiba's corporate value.

October, 2022

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>**History of Value Creation—Toshiba's DNA**

Toshiba's roots can be traced back to the time when the heritage of two men—Hisashige Tanaka, dubbed *Karakuri Giemon* (inventor of mechanical devices), and Ichisuke Fujioka, known as the Thomas Edison of Japan—joined forces.

Tanaka Engineering Works (later Shibaura Engineering Works), founded by Tanaka in 1873, and Hakunetsu-sha, established by Fujioka in 1890, were the two companies that would eventually become Toshiba Corporation. They both were business ventures that dreamed of a bright future for Japan, aspiring to create something never seen before that would benefit people and society.

### **Toshiba's Roots Committed to People, Committed to the Future.**

"Committed to People, Committed to the Future." is the long standing Basic Commitment of Toshiba Group that expresses our credo since founding to always be on the watch for issues facing society amid the changing times and resolve them through business.

Today, in our everyday lives, we are asked to be responsible for a sustainable future. Natural disasters caused by climate change threaten the safety and security of our lives. Social and environmental stability are impaired by problems such as information inequality and natural resource depletion.

### **Our unwavering drive to make and do things that lead to a better world for over 140 years**

![](_page_11_Picture_8.jpeg)

### **Toshiba's Technology to Turn on the Promise of a New Day**

### Founding

In 1930, Toshiba released Japan's first electric washing machines and completed Japan's first electric refrigerators. In 1955, the Company also released Japan's first electric rice cookers.

At a time when many women's lives were bound to the domestic realm, these products allowed women to have more free time.

#### 1960s

The automated mail processing equipment completed in 1967 was the world's first to mechanize manual work by recognizing handwritten characters, and became a forerunner of labor-saving equipment in the advanced information society.

At the same time, it led to the widespread use of optical character reading (OCR) technology, automatic ticket gates, and other cutting-edge image recognition technologies. In addition, research on superconducting materials, which began in the early 1960s, has borne fruit in the form of heavy ion cancer treatment devices, leading to the technology for next-generation medicine.

#### 1970s

In 1978, Toshiba completed Japan's first practical *kana-kanji* conversion system and released Japan's first Japanese word processor.

The development of *kana-kanji* conversion technology and high-capacity storage led to mobile music devices enjoyed by people out on the street, e-mail, social media, and other methods of communication, which have become the norm today.

### 1980s

Toshiba commercialized the world's first laptop personal computer in 1985, and the world's first NAND flash memory in 1991. These developments laid the foundation for an internet-driven society.

{12}------------------------------------------------

Toshiba is working for a sustainable future for the earth and its people by contributing to the realization of carbon neutrality and a circular economy.

Specific initiatives include protecting the safety and security of individual livelihoods by building infrastructure that is accessible to everyone, and ensuring social and environmental stability by building a society connected by data.

For many years now, Toshiba has engaged in businesses that support essential social infrastructure, including power generation, water treatment and transportation. Today, the knowledge, technology and customer connections cultivated thorough these businesses are invaluable assets. We will draw on them as we continue to create previously unseen value by maximizing the power of data.

Japan's first carbon capture unit to capture over 50% of total CO2 emissions from a thermal power plant

#### 2010s

In 2017, Toshiba developed the world's first practical multi parameters phased array weather radar.

As torrential rains are caused by locally and rapidly developing cumulonimbus clouds, they had been considered difficult to predict. However, the multi parameters phased array weather radar makes it possible to predict the signs of torrential rains and resulting rainfall quickly and accurately.

#### 2020s

In 2021, Toshiba developed the world's largest film-based perovskite photovoltaic module with the world's highest power generation efficiency. The module can be installed in urban areas where it is difficult to secure a large area of land, even on the walls of buildings and condominiums and the roofs of large vehicles, which used to be considered unsuitable for installation.

"We want to be the first to deliver products and services that make people's dreams come true and change society." This passion has been the source of Toshiba's products and services.

Toshiba's technology has altered the way people live and has also changed society.

### **Toshiba Group's Vision**

**Contribute to the achievement of carbon neutrality & circular economy through digitization**

### **Committed to People, Committed to the Future.**

At Toshiba, we commit to raising the quality of life for people around the world, ensuring progress

that is in harmony with our planet.

### **Future**

![](_page_13_Figure_6.jpeg)

### **People Safe, secure lifestyles for everyone**

Poverty, human rights, disasters, disputes

**Building an infrastructure that everyone can enjoy**

### **Planet Social and environmental stability**

Education, equality & fairness, climate change, resource depletion

**Building a society connected by data**

"Committed to People, Committed to the Future," this is the basic commitment of Toshiba. We commit to raising the quality of life for people around the world, ensuring progress that is in harmony with our planet.

It is important to first protect the safety and security of everyday life of each individual. It is to make a world without poverty, disasters or conflicts. What we can do is to "build an infrastructure that everyone can enjoy."

Once "People" are satisfied, the next level is to consider the "Planet." Realization of social and environmental stability becomes the next important step, and Toshiba aims to "build a society connected by data."

After the society is further stabilized, we will move on to consider the "Future." In other words, the greater question becomes the future of our children, and the sustainability of people and the planet. What we can do and what we should do is to "realize carbon neutrality and circular economy."

As a means to realize these things that need to be done, "digital" is important. As the digital economy evolves, new social value will be created in the future having various companies get connected across industrial boundaries.

### Evolution of the digital economy

![](_page_13_Figure_19.jpeg)

{14}------------------------------------------------

Toshiba has identified the DE, DX, and QX strategy to respond to those changes.

The first stage of its development is the digital evolution (DE) to enhance services and recurring businesses. That is to be followed by the digital transformation (DX), which is a stage to build platforms based on DE. We will further develop this into a quantum transformation (QX), a quantum world where various platforms are connected across industries.

**Many businesses contribute to economic security by supplying core infrastructure and**

### **Current Status of Toshiba Group**

For more than 100 years, Toshiba group has been involved in businesses that support critical public infrastructures, such as electric power and railroads. We hold the No.1 market share in many of these businesses including water supply and sewerage systems. These businesses will be valuable assets for a digital business.

### **Impact of the Toshiba Next Plan and Efforts toward Further Enhancement of Core Profitability**

**Steady improvement in core profitability at each segment**

![](_page_15_Figure_5.jpeg)

Under the Toshiba Next Plan, launched in 2018, we have been working to strengthen core profitability as Phase 1. Despite the impact of COVID in FY20 and a shortage of semiconductors and soaring material prices in the previous fiscal year, profitability has recovered steadily in all segments so far, and we have seen four-point improvement in the overall income margin.

In particular, the digital solutions business have shown stable improvement, which we attribute to our steady improvement efforts, such as standardization of software development processes and utilization of overseas software development bases.

Going forward, we intend to build a stronger earning structure by expanding this successful example to the entire company.

{16}------------------------------------------------

### **Expanding from CFT activities and restructuring efforts to value chain transformation**

![](_page_16_Figure_6.jpeg)

Toshiba had focused first on materializing the low hanging fruits that can be achieved in the short term, such as structural reforms and CFT activities in procurement, sales and other areas, and has realized 180 billion yen improvement over four years starting from 2018.

Going forward, we will promote a business process reforms, including design and production and also IT system reforms to realize these reforms as value chain transformation and work to sustainably strengthen core-profitability through a chain of two reforms. Through these activities, we aim to improve profitability by further reducing costs of approximately 70 billion yen by FY25.

### **Update on Activities Aimed at Further Enhancing of Core Profitability**

![](_page_16_Figure_10.jpeg)

With regard to the reduction of the number of subsidiaries, we aim to achieve 40% reduction by FY25, and as of the end of April, 2022, we have already achieved a 30% reduction.

As for initiatives related to a value chain transformation in the area of design and product modularization, we expect to achieve approximately 70% by the end of FY22 toward the completion of modularization of 67 target products by FY25.

In the smart factory initiative, we are aiming to expand to all major production sites, and targeting for 65% of its production sites to reach level 3 by FY25.

{17}------------------------------------------------

### **Resolving Corporate Challenges**

There are two types of rigidities as challenges for Toshiba in achieving its goals.

![](_page_17_Figure_3.jpeg)

### **Challenges: Inability to leverage R&D diversity and convert achievements into business value**

The strength of Toshiba lies in its ability to develop technologies that are completely new to the world. There are many "world's first" that originated from Toshiba. However, Toshiba has not fully capitalized on the business seeds. Toshiba tries to do everything by itself. However, it is the age of ecosystems and platforms. Rather than launching a completely proprietary technologies single-handedly, leveraging its ecosystems to enable earlier takeoff of businesses should lead to significantly greater corporate value.

**External Rigidity** Methodology-related issues

![](_page_17_Figure_6.jpeg)

- (Lack of industry connections and business know-how)
### **Obsession with full or majority ownership**

{18}------------------------------------------------

Here we explain the approach to breaking through these two rigidities and resolving corporate challenges. First, internal rigidity. We will take the steps below for software defined transformation to resolve the internal rigidity.

**Internal Rigidity** Organization-related issues

### **Software Defined Transformation**

- Transform businesses through "DE → DX → QX" evolution and discover new business potential from a data-oriented perspective
#### Integration and optimization of software development

- Aggregate software personnel dispersed throughout Toshiba group
- Improve efficiency through standardized processes

![](_page_18_Figure_12.jpeg)

Currently, the product is developed in a vertically divided organization in silos, and the software is incorporated into the hardware and provided as a part of a system.

To take this to the digital evolution (DE), the first stage, it is important to separate the software from the hardware. This will enable us to add a variety of applications, which will generate new services as well as to enhance the recurring businesses or providing SaaS business; these will greatly contribute to making the business more profitable.

Next, we need to standardize the software so that such software could be connected to other companies' hardware and applications, making it possible to create a platform. Once this is completed, then services will be greatly expanded and the scale-free network comprised of such software will be formed; it will enable data-centric service development as the second stage, called DX. It will be extremely asset-light and also scalable business model that will consequently allow us to achieve exponential growth.

Beyond that, various platforms under DX stage will be created, and a quantum world of quantum transformation (QX) will emerge, in which optimal solutions are identified from a complex interplay of platforms.

{19}------------------------------------------------

### **Toshiba Group Management Policy - Vision for Transformation -**

We have named this project as "SHIBUYA Project" as we call it internally.

![](_page_19_Figure_2.jpeg)

The City of Shibuya is currently undergoing a major transformation. It has fundamentally been transforming the city without stopping millions of people come and go. This is exactly what we are trying to do. We will not stop our business while we revitalize the company.

We will integrate and optimize software development.

### Toshiba Group's software development personnel

![](_page_19_Figure_6.jpeg)

![](_page_19_Figure_7.jpeg)

A far greater number of software development personnel currently belong to non-digital segment and are dispersed over our 30 group companies. And there are many things that can be improved in devilment practices and staffing. We will thoroughly improve this going forward.

{20}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_20_Figure_5.jpeg)

Platforms emerge from the consumer diamond on the right, just as the so-called GAFA are collecting data directly from consumers. However, even there, there are much data that can be extracted from the hardware that so far has not yet been acquired. POS, lighting, elevators and other businesses will greatly contribute to the acquisition of such human data. In terms of acquiring human data, these are our focus areas.

Furthermore, in the B2B area on the left, data acquisition has not been accomplished. Many companies try to acquire data from large corporations in this very small end, but it is very difficult. In fact, when we take a look at successful examples of acquiring human data, it is more reasonable to capture data from the bigger diamond.

We will tackle both these diamonds. Toshiba hopes to become a platformer in both of these areas, especially in the B2B area where data acquisition has not been successfully accomplished yet.

{21}------------------------------------------------

### **Toshiba Group Management Policy - Vision for Transformation -**

Realizing the value of potential technologies is the way to resolve the external rigidity.

**External Rigidity** Methodology-related issues

### **Realizing the value of potential technologies**

Consider working with external partners in order to realize value from high potential technologies with large expected target markets

![](_page_21_Figure_5.jpeg)

*1 Photovoltaics, *2 Estimated global market of PV panels for EV based on the expected number of EVs in 2030 ( <https://www.nedo.go.jp/content/100873452.pdf> ), *3 Fuji-Keizai: Trends in advanced PV development and market outlook in future(FY2020 version), *4 Niobium Titanium Oxide , *5 Estimated by Fuji-Keizai Outlook of energy, large size rechargeable batteries and materials(2020) , *6 LiDAR module global market estimated by 3D LiDAR marketing analysis(TSR) etc., *7 Global market of security screening systems,*8 MEMS sensor global market in global forecast in 2030(SDKI Inc.)

Toshiba's strength lies in its diversity in its development. In the past, we have created and introduced products that had never existed before by combining technologies in many areas.

Even today, for example, there are a number of technologies with strong business potential such as semiconductors and material technologies that have an estimated market size of over 2.5 trillion yen. Others are copper oxide tandem PV, perovskite, NTO anode batteries, LiDAR, millimeter wave imaging and MEMS sensors.

However, Toshiba has not fully capitalized on the business seeds. We will promote measures to ensure that values of these high potential technologies to be realized as quickly as possible.

{22}------------------------------------------------

If we determine that values can be realized at an early stage through collaboration with external parties, we will consider using partners such as companies seeking to expand their businesses in a digitalized field or existing players in that field. As a result, we believe that a variety of value can be captured including data utilization and financial returns.

![](_page_22_Figure_6.jpeg)

Toshiba Group has been providing products and services that supports people's lives and society under our Basic Commitment, "Committed to People, Committed to the Future." We believe this is a mission that will not change in the future.

However, in response to the development of the digital economy and the age of ecosystems and platforms, the company must also change through the transformation as DE, DX, and QX. We intend to transform Toshiba into a company that makes data services as pillar of its earnings. To achieve this goal, we need to break through the two rigidities of internal and external rigidity to maximize the potential that Toshiba Group possesses. We are promoting software defined transformation through SHIBUYA Project to separate software from hardware. And we show you the concrete steps that we are taking going forward. Through these transformations, we will become a company that harnesses the power of digital and data to contribute to the realization of carbon neutrality and circular economy.

{23}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-23-0"></span>**Toshiba Group Technology Strategy**

### **Toshiba Group Technology Policy**

Carbon neutrality has been promoted worldwide by shifting to renewable energy. In addition, since our life has been significantly influenced by escalation of natural disasters, aging social infrastructures, a decrease in working population, pandemics, and cyberattacks, infrastructure resilience has been increasingly needed.

Through a good track record in productization and systematization mainly in the energy/social infrastructures field over 145 years, Toshiba Group has cultivated research and development ability to generate "1" from "0" leveraging technological diversity, as well as combined strength in engineering ability to structure devices, components, and systems meeting social and customer needs as solutions.

Using such strengths, the Group will promote provision of infrastructure services centering on "TOSHIBA SPINEX" brand based on open IoT reference architecture, leading the carbon neutrality and the realization of resilient infrastructures, guided by the Basic Commitment "Committed to People, Committed to the Future."

Going forward, the Group will aim at creation of products, systems, and services which contribute to creation of new social values toward resolution of social issues, by promoting DE/DX and QX that provide platforms using industrial and human data, with a core of differentiated devices, components, and systems.

### **Toshiba Group R&D Structure**

Toshiba conducts research and development that best suit the purpose, from both aspects of seeds-oriented R&D triggered by future technologies and concepts, and needs-oriented R&D based on customer feedback and product planning. We have a research and development structure in which our relevant sites are categorized according to their role. Corporate R&D organizations that tackle basic and fundamental research from a medium- to long-term perspective; R&D organizations of Group companies that engage in short- and midterm core technology development; and design and engineering divisions of Group companies that are geared to realizing products and services. This structure is optimal for solving technological challenges.

![](_page_24_Figure_7.jpeg)

Toshiba has built research and development sites not only in Japan but also in the United States, Europe, China, India, Vietnam, among others. These sites cooperate organically across borders to conduct a wide array of cutting-edge research and development on a global basis. In order to boost our global competitiveness, we are improving our capacity to respond swiftly to changes in the market, in our research and development as well. Particularly in China and the rest of Asia, where markets are expanding, we are working to locally operate not only manufacturing sites, but also engineering sites and development sites. Going forward, our research and development in emerging countries will create products and services that will appeal to the global market including in developed countries.

{25}------------------------------------------------

### **R&D Cases to Create New Values**

As R&D cases to realize a carbon neutral society and services based on industrial and people-flow data, we introduce initiatives for a transparent Cu2O solar cell and face recognition AI technology. In the transparent Cu2O solar cell, we have been developing a highly efficient and low-cost tandem solar cell, and confirmed that it has potential of exceeding the world's highest efficiency in silicon solar cells as Cu2O-Si tandem solar cell. Furthermore, Toshiba's unique face recognition AI achieved the highest recognition accuracy in Japanese companies in Face Recognition Vendor Test Ongoing by National Institute of Standards and Technology.

### **Toshiba Developed Transparent Cu2O Solar Cell Which Achieved the World's Highest Efficiency for Highly Efficient and Low-cost Tandem Solar Cell**

Toward the realization of a carbon neutral society, in Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced "Green Growth Strategy Through Achieving Carbon Neutrality in 2050"*1 which declared the policy of increasing a percentage of renewable energy in the domestic power generation amount to 50-60% by 2050. Especially, to promote transportation electrification, the tandem solar cell which can supply power necessary for operation is expected to be more needed by mobility systems such as automobiles and trains which offer only limited installation space for a solar cell.

Tandem solar cells can raise an overall conversion efficiency by layering two solar cells as a bottom cell and a top cell to generate power together. While the development of a highly efficient and low-cost top cell which can be layered over an existing silicon solar cell was going ahead, Toshiba developed a low-cost transparent Cu2O solar cell*2 as a top cell for the first time in the world in 2019. This time, Toshiba successfully realized the world's highest conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.5% by curbing impurities in the power generation layer and increasing the power generation area from 3x3mm² to 10x3mm².*3 In addition, it was confirmed that the Cu2O-Si tandem solar cell with a Cu2O solar cell layered over silicon (Si) solar cell has potential of exceeding the world's highest PCE of 26.7%*4 in silicon solar cells. In case of an electric vehicle (EV) equipped with the Cu2O-Si tandem solar cell, a one-time charge is estimated to enable the solar cell to power the EV for 37km for a day.*5

Going forward, Toshiba will push ahead with the development in order to achieve the PCE of 10%, a target value of the top Cu2O cells for high efficiency tandem solar cells (PCE=30%), entrusted by New Energy and Industry Technology Development Organization (NEDO). Apart from the entrusted project from NEDO, Toshiba will cooperate with Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation to aim to complete manufacturing technology for several inch-Cu2O-Si tandem solar cells around the same size as today's mainstream silicon solar cells by FY2025.

### **Toshiba Achieved the Highest Recognition Accuracy in Japanese Companies in Face Recognition Vendor Test Ongoing by National Institute of Standards and Technology**

In the face recognition technology that Toshiba has researched and developed for many years, it was at top level in the world, and ranked top in Japanese companies*1 in three categories of a face recognition benchmark test (FRVT Ongoing 1:1 Verification*2) hosted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST*3).

Toshiba's unique face recognition AI to identify an individual from an image registers a face of a person to be identified with a face database in advance to check the person in the image in real time and grants metadata. As "Kaometa®," a face recognition AI for broadcasters and other media, Toshiba Digital Solutions Corporation began to provide services in April 2020. The face recognition AI supports operations such as quick and accurate production of TV programs, by precisely recognizing a face of a person in an image in real time to identify the person.

Toshiba's face recognition technology could very accurately recognize an individual in "VISABORDER category," "1:1 Verification," a verification test using images taken at time of entry and departure, and was ranked ninth in the world, and first in Japanese companies. Also, in "BORDER Photos category," a verification test using images taken at time of crossing a border, it ranked eighth in the world, and first in Japanese companies. Furthermore, in "MUGSHOT Photos ΔT ≥12 YRS category," a verification test using face images which degraded over 12 years or more, it ranked ninth in the world, and first in Japanese companies.*4

Toshiba Group has offered non-contact identity verification services using the face recognition technology in various aspects. In order to contribute to a society by providing safer, more secure and convenient services, the Group will also appropriately use extensive person recognition technologies including technology to chase a person in reference to clothes and other appearance*5 depending on the situation while paying adequate attention to privacy.

### **Intellectual Property Strategy**

Toshiba Group is aiming at expanding opportunities for solving social issues and maximizing corporate values by implementing intellectual property (IP) strategies.

In the service segment that respectively combine Energy and Infrastructure with Digital, it is important to expand opportunities for solving social issues and formulate an IP strategy to make a success of business, taking into account the entire business including not only the service segment but also the cyber segment and the physical segment. Therefore, Toshiba Group has emphasized on conceptualizing IP strategies from various perspectives such as collaboration creation with business partners and utilization of IPs, overviewing the entire business schemes.

In order to perform IP strategies, it is essential to manage IP items (patents, data, know-how, and the like). Especially, in the cyber segment, as it would be important how to handle data and to keep and manage a secret as confidential information to prevent leakage of expertise, we thoroughly strengthen utilization and protection of data, and management of expertise (keeping secrets).

In addition, as a basis of IP strategies, intellectual properties which support advantageous technologies and products are essential, particularly in the physical segment. Therefore, we are focusing on enhancing IP capabilities by creating IP based on IP information analysis and IP strategies, optimizing IP portfolios in consideration of competitiveness, and having free to operate throughtpatent clearance for other companies.

### Toshiba Group Intellectual Property Policy

### **Expand opportunities to resolve social issues and maximize corporate value**

{28}------------------------------------------------

### **The Organizational Structure Concerning Intellectual Property**

The organizational structure of the Intellectual Property Division is composed of the Intellectual Property Office in the corporate staff division, and the intellectual property divisions at our individual laboratories and key Group companies. The Intellectual Property Office in the corporate staff division is responsible for, related to Intellectual Property across Toshiba Group, formulating and promoting strategy and measures, handing contracts and disputes, managing patent information and deals with matters related to intellectual property right laws, such as the Copyright Law. Meanwhile, the intellectual property divisions of research laboratories and key Group companies pursue intellectual property strategies in their respective development and business domains and work to strengthen their intellectual property activities in order to build a superior intellectual property portfolio. Personnel in charge of intellectual property are stationed in the United States and China, promoting our IP strategies on a global basis.

In relation to management resource allocation including investment in intellectual properties, and implementation of strategies related to business portfolios, each Executive Officer reports a progress in initiatives to the Board of Directors, and is provided with supervision and advice from the Board.

![](_page_28_Figure_8.jpeg)

### **Education on Intellectual Properties**

Every year, e-learning for Standards of Conduct for Toshiba Group is provided to employees of Toshiba Group in Japan for the purpose of making them reaffirm the code of behavior including IP rights and reminding them of matters mainly related to copyrights. In FY2021, 99.4% of the employees attended the education.

In addition, we provide general education on IP rights to new employees in Corporate Entry Program (CEP), then offer education by job rank in light of each business division.

A basic educational program has been provided for IP personnel in order to enable them to respond to practical operations in two years through learning knowledge on domestic and overseas IP rights, preparation of patent specifications, and practical training with office action/OJT for intermediate procedures, etc.

In addition, we provide education at our overseas subsidiaries that is appropriate for each region. For example, our Chinese subsidiaries provide copyright training on the proper use of software, and our U.S. subsidiaries provide intellectual property training targeting both newly hired and existing employees.

{29}------------------------------------------------

### **Intellectual Property**

### Global Patent Portfolio

A majority of patents are applied for overseas, mainly in the U.S. and China, to operate business globally. In each business segment, items to be applied for a patent are selected so that the optimal portfolio can be created based on IP strategies.

The number of patent applications over the past three years is as follows.

### Protection of the Toshiba Brand

The Toshiba brand symbolizes the corporate value of Toshiba Group, and the value of the goods and services that Toshiba Group provides. In order to ensure that the Toshiba brand is intact, we have worked to manage trademark rights and eliminate counterfeit products.

Failure to take action against counterfeits of Toshiba products would pose not only the risk of damage to Toshiba's brand value and public confidence, but also the risk of customers mistaking counterfeit products as genuine, finding the purchase does not deliver the expected performance, and being involved in an accident. To prevent this, we strive to eliminate counterfeit products, collaborating with domestic and overseas anti-counterfeit organizations, and are actively appealing to local government agencies and other organizations for more stringent control.

### **Global Rollout of the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**

increased sales, etc.

Today's society is seeing explosive growth in the volume of data as a result of technological progress, and the secure communication of confidential information is an urgent issue. In order to protect individual, corporate, and state information, the Toshiba Group has been researching and developing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology for more than 20 years, and has acquired more patents in this area than any other organization globally.

QKD is used to distribute the encryption keys that are used to protect important confidential data. In QKD, encryption keys are transmitted over optical fibers in the form of photons (light particles). A feature of quantum mechanics is that photons undergo an unavoidable change in state when they come into contact with something, and using this property enables the indisputable detection of encryption key eavesdropping by third parties. At the instant the encryption key eavesdropping is detected the key is automatically voided and a new one is created, so in theory it is impossible to eavesdrop an encryption key. The introduction of QKD would enable data communication platforms to be protected from the threat of cyber attacks, and ensure the security of data communications.

The Toshiba Group is establishing partnerships in related industries and conducting repeated demonstrations and testing, aiming for an early rollout of QKD in industries in the U.S., U.K., Singapore, and South Korea,

> as well as in Japan. In August 2021, the Group announced a collaboration with Singapore's SpeQtral Pte. Ltd., and in October 2021 it announced that it would work with the U.K.'s British Telecommunications plc to build, demonstrate and test world's first quantum-secured commercial metro network. In February 2022, the Toshiba Group, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Ciena conducted testing on the U.S.'s first finance application execution platform, and succeeded in demonstrating the viability of QKD.

> Furthermore, in March 2022, the Toshiba Group began a joint QKD demonstration project with KT Corporation of South Korea. Through these collaborations, the Toshiba Group is accelerating the global rollout of QKD.

ifLink® refers to an IoT platform that makes it easy for anybody to build, use and provide IoT services by allowing users to combine a wide range of generally available IoT equipment (Internet-connectible sensors, IT-enabled home appliances, robots, etc.) with web services without the need for programming. ifLink® was opened up to enable new services and solutions to be generated rapidly in an ecosystem of interconnectability created by its various participants, and the ifLink Open Community consortium was established in 2020 by core members Toshiba and Toshiba Digital Solutions Corporation. With participation by more than 100 companies, schools, and other organizations, the community voluntarily promotes mutual links between IoT products and web services, and the conception, testing and commercialization of ideas. In 2021 these activities gave birth to ClosedBuster™*, a CO2 concentration monitoring service, as a solution for dealing with COVID-19. ClosedBuster™ uses CO2 concentration measuring to detect, visualize, and take action with regard to the airtightness of stores and other facilities, and is used by major restaurant chains and other organizations to prevent COVID-19 from infecting or spreading to others. These activities have been praised as an example of corporations cooperating on COVID-19 countermeasures, and have received awards from multiple

organizations. In addition, the methods used by ifLink® from the stages of conception to testing are being considered for inclusion as part of the high school educational curriculum for digital transformation (DX). Going forward, ifLink Open Community will continue to implement a variety of initiatives to resolve social issues and to develop human resources in its role as a community for linking corporations and schools.

### **Transfer of Chubu Toshiba Engineering Corporation Stock**

### **Launch of 20Ah-HP Rechargeable Lithium-ion Battery Cell That Delivers Both High Energy and High Power**

Toshiba has hitherto developed a lineup of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries in the two categories of high-power cells and high-capacity cells, and in January 2022 it began taking orders for a new SCiB™ product, the 20Ah-HP, which combines the advantages of both types.

For rechargeable lithium-ion batteries it is generally difficult to combine energy density with high input/ output performance. High energy density is a measure of high endurance and in applications such as electric vehicles, for example, this means a longer range. On the other hand, input/output performance (which is a measure of instantaneous power) deteriorates, making it difficult to use in situations that require sharp inflows or outflows of energy, such as rapid charging.

The 20Ah-HP succeeds in maintaining an energy density at the level of the 20Ah cell, one of the aforementioned high-capacity cells, while reducing internal resistance by 40%, achieving approximately 1.7 times the input performance and 1.6 times the output performance compared to the 20Ah cell. The reduction in internal resistance results in the suppression of heat buildup when large currents are applied, enabling cooling systems to be simplified and made less costly. Another advantage of SCiB™ products is that the usable capacity

20Ah-HP Cell

range is larger than that of other rechargeable batteries, and the reduced overvoltage of the 20Ah-HP cell is a factor in increasing the range of capacities that can be used. Moreover, because the input/output performance has been improved while maintaining the size of previous "highcapacity cells," it can be used without design changes in applications where existing "highcapacity cells" are being used.

By combining high input/output performance with high energy density, the 20Ah-HP cell expands the range of applications open to SCiB™ products, and is expected to be used not only in vehicles but also in a wide variety of industries, including manufacturing and distribution systems, harbor facilities, construction, maritime and traffic equipment, and storage systems. Going forward, Toshiba will continue to actively develop the SCiB™ rechargeable lithium-ion battery business for a range of different applications, including vehicles, industrial equipment and storage battery systems, as it contributes to achieving a carbon-neutral society.

### **Committed to People, Committed to the Future.**

In order to develop sustainably as a company, Toshiba Group strives to strengthen E (environment), S (social), and G (governance) and implement sustainability management as steps to build ethical and transparent management foundations. At the same time, we will make efforts to create and provide rich value in collaboration with our various stakeholders, such as our customers, shareholders and investors, suppliers, employees, and local communities. We conduct all corporate activities fairly and honestly, guided by **[the Standards of Con](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/sustainability/corporate/standards-of-conduct.html)[duct for Toshiba Group](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/sustainability/corporate/standards-of-conduct.html)** .

{47}------------------------------------------------

### **Sustainability Management Structure**

In 2003 Toshiba established an in-house organization to promote CSR, and has put in place a promotion system that covers the Group. As companies are urged to make more effort to help solve global issues represented in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and help create a sustainable society, we established the Sustainability Management Division in April 2021. Incorporating a sustainability perspective into management, we promote ESG and SDGs activities through all of our corporate activities.

We reviewed our sustainability management structure and newly established the Sustainability Strategy Committee chaired by the President and CEO with members comprising executives related to sustainability, presidents of key Group companies*, and managers related to sustainability. Starting from FY2021, the committee meeting is held twice a year as a general rule. The Sustainability Strategy Committee decides on strategies and measures to promote sustainability in Toshiba Group. At its meeting held in August 2021, the committee discussed and identified new material issues (important issues).

Under the Sustainability Strategy Committee, we set up three committees, namely the Sustainability Promotion Committee that considers specific measures based on decisions made by the Sustainability Strategy Committee, develops an action plan, and monitors progress; the Corporate Environmental Management Committee that has functioned since 1991; and the Non-financial Information Disclosure Committee that approves the disclosure of ESG information to be included in our Integrated Report and Sustainability Report. The Sustainability Promotion Committee is chaired by the executive in charge of sustainability. The Corporate Environmental Management Committee is chaired by the executive in charge of environment. As a general rule, each of the committees holds a meeting twice a year to discuss and examine various measures that Toshiba Group is promoting.

The executive in charge of sustainability and environment regularly report the status of measures being taken and receive supervision and advice at the Board of Directors meetings.

### **Increasing Employee Awareness of Sustainability**

In order to raise sustainability awareness of employees in Toshiba Group, the President and CEO reaffirms the philosophy of Basic Commitment of the Toshiba Group at every opportunity, such as the start of each half-year term, at company ceremonies, and at start-of-year addresses. The importance of implementing sustainability management is also communicated. We also conduct sustainability management-related training for newly hired employees and newly appointed managers as needed as well as annual e-learning for all employees in line with the Standards of Conduct for Toshiba Group in areas such as the environment, information security, respect for human rights, engineering ethics, compliance with antitrust laws and prohibition of bribery.

#### Toshiba Group's Sustainability Month

Since FY2006, Toshiba Group has designated December as Sustainability Month (renamed from CSR Month in FY2020). During this month, we hold seminars on topics such as human rights, and concentrate on social contribution activities at each of the Group companies and business sites.

In FY2021, the President and CEO explained in his message the reidentification of the Company's material issues and also the importance of sustainability-related initiatives including active participation in those addressing climate change and social contribution activities. He also spoke of his desire for every employee to reconsider how their individual work can link in with society.

During the month, Mr. Kenji Fuma, CEO of Neural Inc. gave an online seminar on the ESG and initiatives towards carbon neutrality which companies are expected to achieve. We also utilized our internal website to distribute the content aimed at deepening knowledge of ESG and the Toshiba Group's sustainability management as well as seminars on human rights, and also to share examples of social contribution activities and health and safety activities that were commended for their excellence.

Additionally, in FY2021, an annually-held Toshiba Group Volunteer Days event took place at the beginning of December, which is around the International Volunteer Day on December 5, to provide volunteering opportunities for all Toshiba Group employees.

Moving forward, we will continue to work to raise each employee's awareness of sustainability.

# <span id="page-49-0"></span>**Material Issues and KPIs**

Guided by the Essence of Toshiba, Toshiba Group works on material issues that could impact business activities from a medium and longterm perspective in accordance with the Sustainability Policy and promotes sustainability management that contributes to the development of society.

We have tackled the material issues identified in 2013 by regularly confirming their status. However, response to climate change is now required on a global scale, and social issues are changing according to various perspectives as seen in the SDGs adopted by the United Nations. Toshiba Group also reviewed its businesses. Accordingly, we re-identified new material issues in FY2021.

We position the material issues under the Essence of Toshiba and the Sustainability Policy, and will work on initiatives Group-wide.

In order to ensure a bright future for people and the planet, Toshiba Group is aiming to realize carbon neutrality and a circular economy. Specifically, we will make maximum use of the power of data to build infrastructure that everyone can enjoy in the safe and secure life and a connected data society that will ensure social and environmental stability.

We recognize that the "strengthen cyber resilience", which is indispensable to promoting data-based business, the "strengthen R&D to stimulate innovation", which forms the foundation of our business, and the "secure, retain and train human resources" are material issues especially tied to our business deeply., Toshiba Group address all our material issues including these with integrity.

### **KPIs**

The Sustainability Strategy Committee decides on KPIs in line with material issues and we work on them. The Sustainability Promotion Committee monitors efforts related to these items to strengthen future initiatives.

### **Process of Material Issues Identification**

Before re-identifying material issues, Toshiba Group extracted and organized issues with reference to the SDGs, which are universal social issues, the Global Risks Report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), and guidelines including the SASB Standards. We narrowed them down to those of priority, evaluating them by their closeness to the businesses specified in the Mid-term Business Plan that starts from FY2022 and their importance in terms of strengthening the foundations to drive businesses. External experts then reviewed the draft of the selected issues. In August 2021, the Sustainability Strategy Committee chaired by the President and CEO confirmed the selection. The re-identified material issues were also reported to the Executive session of the Board in September 2021.

### For the irreplaceable global environment in which we live

### **Environmental Future Vision 2050**

In recent years, climate change, the depletion of energy and resources, and various other environmental issues have intensified, to the point where they threaten the safe, secure lives of future generations. With regard to climate change in particular, given the impacts of typhoons, floods, and droughts in many parts of the world, the movement toward carbon neutrality has been accelerated in each country. In the face of these circumstances, companies are required to take proactive measures. In addition, countries worldwide have been trying to address issues such as the transition to a circular economy, marine plastics, water resources, and biodiversity conservation; and society's interest in such issues are on the rise.

As such, Toshiba Group formulated the Environmental Future Vision 2050 as a new long-term vision to address carbon neutrality, the circular economy, and other issues from a global perspective. With the goal of "contributing to the realization of a sustainable society through environmental management which aims to create enriched value and to ensure harmony with the earth," the Environmental Future Vision 2050 aims to realize a sustainable society – in other words, a decarbonized society, a resource circulating society, and a society in harmony with nature. We will promote the implementation of initiatives in three areas; "response to climate change," "response to the circular economy," and "consideration of ecosystems" so as to realize the ideal situation in 2050.

Toshiba Group regards these three areas stated in the Environmental Future Vision 2050 as environmental materiality. Positioning the environmental initiatives as material issues which would lead to an increase in corporate values, the Group will promote corporate activities in consideration of the present and future global environment through the entire value chain including design, procurement, manufacture, distribution, sale, and disposal.

### Respond to Climate Change

![](_page_52_Picture_7.jpeg)

To respond to the issues of global warming, which may increase the possibility of natural disasters including typhoons, floods, tornadoes, droughts, and sea level rise, the world is accelerating movements toward achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, which is essentially net zero in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Under Environmental Future Vision 2050, Toshiba Group will promote the reduction of GHG emissions in product manufacturing and in the use of products and services; and the reduction of GHG emissions derived from products and services purchased in cooperation with suppliers, in order to respond to climate change throughout its entire value chain. Toshiba Group also aims to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society by promoting businesses related to climate change adaptation measures.

### For further strengthening thorough governance

Toshiba Group practices transparent corporate governance and optimal internal controls; and executes management with integrity, trusted by stakeholders.

As a sustainable company operating under the Basic Commitment of "Committed to People, Committed to the Future," we aim to leverage our business activities towards the development of our society and the realization of a sustainable society.

We have set "strengthen governance" and "strengthen cyber resilience" as our material issues along with specific KPIs, which we are working to achieve through our initiatives.

**[Material Issues and KPIs](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/sustainability/corporate/csr-management/materiality.html)**

### **KPIs and Achievements in Governance**

### Strengthen Governance

The basic policy and objectives of Toshiba's corporate governance are to realize sustainable growth and raise the enterprise value of the Group over the medium- to long-term, and to contribute to the interests of all stakeholders, including shareholders, investors, employees, customers, business partners, creditors, and local communities.

Our **[Corporate Governance Guidelines](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/ir/corporate/esg/governance.html)** stipulate that outside directors comprise a majority (50% or greater) of directors so that the Board of Directors can appropriately perform monitoring and supervisory functions.

Strengthen Cyber Resilience

Toshiba Group is engaged in businesses centered on energy, social infrastructure, electronic devices, and digital solutions, helping support people's lives. We consider it our responsibility to leverage the knowledge and experience we have acquired through manufacturing since our founding, not just in the physical world but also in the online connected world that extends into all areas, in order to strengthen cyber security, protect society, and deliver peace of mind.

To ensure total security for information, products, control, and data, Toshiba Group has adopted the concept of "cyber resilience", which is the ability to prepare for possible cyber-attacks and other security incidents, minimize their impact, and recover as quickly as possible. To put this concept into practice, we have defined the following three parameters: P for "prepare," M for "mitigate," and R for "respond & recover." P denotes preparations for cyber security incidents; M signifies mitigation of a loss caused by an incident; and R indicates the time required to deal with and recover from an incident. To become cyber-resilient, it is necessary to promote P and M and reduce R. To realize such cyber resilience, Toshiba Group promotes comprehensive cyber security measures from the three perspectives of governance, security operations, and human resource development.

# <span id="page-59-0"></span>**Information Disclosure Based on the TCFD Recommendations**

The impact of climate change is intensifying every year, society's interest in this issue is on the rise, triggering demands that companies step up their actions. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which was established by the Financial Stability Board, published its final report in 2017 that urged companies to disclose information on their climate-related risks and opportunities. We have endorsed the TCFD recommendations and are a member of the TCFD Consortium, which aims to promote actions by organizations in Japan in support of the TCFD recommendations. We aim to proactively disclose information on climate change in the four areas (Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets) specified by the TCFD.

### **Governance**

We have a system in place that has the Board of Directors appropriately supervise our efforts to address climate change and other important sustainability-related issues. Important policies, strategies, and measures concerning sustainability are discussed at the Sustainability Strategy Committee meeting held twice a year before they are reported to the Board of Directors. Executives related to sustainability, presidents of key Group companies, and managers related to sustainability participate in the meetings of the Sustainability Strategy Committee chaired by the President and CEO. Of the items discussed at this meeting, the Executive in charge of Sustainability and the Executive in charge of Environment report on important issues related to management at the Board of Directors meetings to be reflected in the Group's business strategy twice a year.

In FY2020, the Sustainability Strategy Committee reported on the progress of initiatives related to the Science Based Targets (SBT), TCFD, and the long-term vision entitled "Toshiba Group's Environmental Future Vision 2050" to the Board of Directors. In FY2021, the Board of Directors resolved to adopt a new policy on sustainability management, which includes the company's response to climate change, in the Toshiba Group Sustainability Policy.

More detailed measures and policies related to the environment are discussed at the meetings of the Corporate Environmental Management Committee set up under the Sustainability Strategy Committee. The Corporate Environmental Management Committee meeting, chaired by the Executive in charge of Environment, is held twice a year and is attended by environmental promotion managers of key Group companies and corporate staff division managers. What is discussed here is then spread within each Group company in the Environmental Management Committee of Group Companies meetings to be held at key Group companies.

{60}------------------------------------------------

### **Strategy**

Under the Sustainability Strategy Committee chaired by the President and CEO, we conduct scenario analysis for each business domain to grasp climate change-related risks and opportunities.

### **Setting scenarios**

In scenario analysis, we set up the following two scenarios:

#### 1.5°C and well-below 2°C scenario:

For mainly transition risks and opportunities, we use the B2DS, SDS, and NZE2050 scenarios created by the International Energy Agency (IEA), assuming a world where the temperature increases by 1.5°C and well-below 2°C. This scenario predicts increase in costs due to carbon tax, energy saving related regulations, the introduction of renewable energy, etc., as well as increase in business opportunities due to growing demand for energy technologies to realize decarbonization and energy-saving products and services.

#### 4°C scenario:

For mainly physical risks and opportunities, we use the RCP8.5 scenario by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), assuming a world where the temperature increases by 4°C. Although this scenario does not predict a greater impact of regulations and technology than the 1.5°C and well-below 2°C scenario, the impact of physical damage such as greater risk of natural disasters like typhoons and flooding caused by unusual weather may increase.

### **Analysis method**

#### Scope:

Our scenario analysis is conducted in the following five business domains taking into consideration the scale of the business and the significance of the impact of climate change. Since each domain has a range of businesses and the content and degree of impact of risks and opportunities vary according to the business, we conduct a detailed analysis for each business division to identify risks and opportunities that are specific to each business. Not stopping at the initiatives of our own company, the analysis covers the entire value chain including the upstream (suppliers) and downstream (customers, users).

- Energy Systems & Solutions Business
- Infrastructure Systems & Solutions Business
- Electronic Devices & Storage Solutions Business
- Digital Solutions Business
- Battery Business

#### Time frames :

Three time frames are set (short-, mid-, and long-terms). We assumed the present to 3 years as the short-term in light of the period of Toshiba Group's Seventh Environmental Action Plan (final year: FY2023), 4 to 10 years as the mid-term in light of the setting periods of Toshiba Group's management policy (FY2025 and FY2030), and 11 to 30 years as the long-term in light of Toshiba Group's Environmental Future Vision 2050.

#### Analysis steps:

We conduct scenario analysis in line with the steps, "Risk importance assessment," "Definition of scenario groups," "Business impact assessment," and "Definition of countermeasures" based on the TCFD recommendations.

In the most recent scenario analysis, we used a common format in the business domains listed in the above scope. First, each business division identifies transition and physical risks and opportunities that climate change would pose to their respective business in line with the two scenarios, "1.5°C and well-below 2°C" and "4°C," based on the risk and opportunity categories presented in the TCFD recommendations, in light of the relevant business circumstances. Then, each business division assesses the importance of each risk and opportunity in accordance with the company-wide assessment standards. We set (1) three levels of impact (assessed by impact on sales or expense amounts) and (2) three levels of likelihood (assessed by probability and frequency) as the assessment standards. By multiplying the two assessment results, we categorize the final importance into one of three levels: low, medium, and high. Note that in this report we have mainly disclosed risks and opportunities with medium and higher importance based on the assessment results.

In addition, these analysis results were reviewed by related corporate staff divisions (Strategic Planning Division, IR Division, Sustainability Division, Environment Division) to reflect the viewpoint of each area of expertise. Moreover, of the risks and opportunities that have been identified and assessed, those with particularly high importance or those that are unique to each business will be calculated for the amount of financial impact by setting parameters, and we will give priority to formulating countermeasures for such items.

The main results of the latest scenario analysis conducted in 2022 are as follows.

As a result of the scenario analysis for each business assuming the 1.5°C and well-below 2°C scenario and the 4°C scenario, we identified different risk factors depending on the characteristics of each business. For example, technology and market risks of renewable energy-related products in the Energy Systems & Solutions business, policy and legal risks concerning GHG emissions in manufacturing processes in the Electronic Devices & Storage Solutions business, and risks related to human resources in the Digital Solutions business. As for opportunities, we also identified various business opportunities for each business, including renewable energy-related technologies, railway systems, disaster management solutions, power semiconductors, ICT solutions that contribute to reducing GHG, and automotive batteries.

### **Countermeasures**

The countermeasures for risks and opportunities that were identified and assessed in the above scenario analysis will be incorporated into part of a future mid-term business plan of each business domain, and its progress will be regularly managed.

Toshiba Group's new management policy announced in FY2022 declares that we regard the social trend toward carbon neutrality as an opportunity and will contribute to achieving carbon neutrality by building infrastructure that everyone can enjoy and a connected data society in our business activities. In addition, as stated in Toshiba Group's material issues as well as long-term vision Environmental Future Vision 2050, we uphold response to climate change as a priority item and aim to achieve carbon neutrality throughout Toshiba Group's entire value chain by FY2050. Going forward, we will continue to reflect scenario analysis results in Toshiba Group's business strategy and engage in sustainable business management while appropriately responding to risks and opportunities of climate change.

### **Risk Management**

Toshiba Group's risk management concerning climate change is incorporated into the company-wide risk management process. For business risks that have significant impact on management including climate-related risks, we clarify management decision criteria, permissible risk limits, and corporate policy on business withdrawal in making management decisions to achieve Toshiba Group's sustainable growth and increase corporate value. In addition, for each risk case, the Business Risk Review Committee conducts risk assessment, identifies the maximum risk, and establishes items for monitoring.

Matters of particular importance are discussed at the Management Meeting. The Business Risk Review Committee meeting is held several times annually as matters arise. Since FY2022, we have added climate-related risks (policy and legal risks, technology risks, market risks, reputation risks, physical risks) based on the TCFD recommendations to the business risk criteria and will work to strengthen the assessment processes concerning climate change.

With regard to risk management specialized for climate change, we identify risks and assess their importance as part of the scenario analysis for the main business domains, which are conducted under the Sustainability Strategy Committee, and share the results with the Committee. For the risks identified and assessed here, the executive in charge of sustainability and the executive in charge of environment bring them up to the Board of Directors meetings to be reflected in the Group's management strategy.

**[Risk Management and Compliance](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/sustainability/corporate/performance/governance/compliance.html)** (Sustainability website)

### **Metrics and Targets**

Under the Environmental Future Vision 2050, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality throughout Toshiba Group's entire value chain by FY2050. As a milestone, we aim to reduce GHG emissions by 70% by FY2030 compared to the FY2019 level.

We set out the following breakdown of GHG reduction target for FY2030 and are promoting related initiatives.

- 1. Reduce the total of Scope 1*1 and Scope 2*2 (GHG emissions generated from Toshiba Group's own business activities) by 70% by FY2030.
- 2. Reduce use-phase GHG emissions of "products and services associated with power supply"*3 sold in Scope 3*4 by 80% by FY2030.
- 3. Reduce use-phase GHG emissions of "products and services associated with power consumption"*5 sold in Scope 3 by 14% by FY2030.
- 4. Reduce GHG emissions from products and services purchased from other companies in Scope 3.

Targets 1 to 3 above are compared to the FY2019 levels. The base year for target 4 is to be determined.

*1: Volume of direct emissions through fuel use at Toshiba Group

*3: Power generation plants, etc.

<sup>*2:</sup> Volume of indirect emissions through use of electricity and heat purchased by Toshiba Group

<sup>*4:</sup> Volume of indirect emissions generated by Toshiba's value chain (raw materials procurement, distribution, sales, disposal, etc.) outside Scopes 1 and 2 *5: Social infrastructure products, building-related products (lighting equipment, elevators and escalators), retail and printing equipment, power semiconductors, etc.

### <span id="page-64-0"></span>**Highlights of Corporate Governance**

![](_page_64_Figure_6.jpeg)

### **Point 1 Each committee composed exclusively of Outside Directors**

The Nomination Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Special Committee, composed exclusively of Outside Directors, determine the content of proposals for the election and dismissal of Directors to be submitted at shareholder meetings, supervise the execution of duties by Executive Officers, determine the content of individual compensation, etc. for each Executive Officer, engage with potential investors and sponsors, and review strategic alternatives. The Nomination Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Special Committee are chaired by Outside Director.

### **Point 2 Directors with a wide range of skills and backgrounds**

Our Board of Directors is composed of Directors with experience in international business, expertise in business portfolio management, business transformation, M&A, capital markets and capital allocation, and deep knowledge in law and compliance, and the composition of Directors could also reflect in management sufficient diversity viewpoints in terms of gender and international experience.

### **Point 3 Establishment of Special Committee**

On April 7, 2022, the Company established a Special Committee, in order to engage with potential investors and sponsors and review strategic alternatives. The Special Committee along with management, will engage in the negotiation process by confirming the potential structures in advance, receiving timely reports on the negotiation status, providing opinions at important junctures. The Special Committee shall also conduct an analysis on thorough process to compare offers and structures, and identify the privatization offer that is best for our diverse stakeholders including shareholders. As a result of the establishment of the Special Committee, the Strategic Review Committee was dissolved.

### **Point 4 Governance Enhancement Committee**

The investigators indicated that the 181st Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on July 31, 2020 had not been conducted fairly as required by the Corporate Governance Code. The Company takes such the indication seriously and determined to initiate an inquiry that would, in an objective and transparent manner, through means including the participation of third parties, investigate and identify root causes, clarify responsibilities, and take appropriate measures to prevent recurrence, in respect of what is referred to in the investigation report as the "Pressure Issue." Thereafter, the Company established the Governance Enhancement Committee and assigned to it the missions of (i) analyzing the root causes; (ii) clarifying responsibility; and (iii) making suggestions on how to develop measures to prevent recurrence. On November 12, 2021, the Company received an investigation report from the Committee and the Company takes the contents of the report seriously, and the Company formulated recurrence prevention measures based on the suggestions contained in the report in December 2021.

# <span id="page-65-0"></span>**Corporate Governance Policy**

### **Basic Views of Corporate Governance**

The basic policy and objectives of Company's corporate governance are to realize sustainable growth and raise the enterprise value of the Group over the medium- to long-term, and to contribute to the interests of all stakeholders, including shareholders, investors, employees, customers, business partners, creditors, and local communities. Under this policy, as the Company puts importance on the Board of Directors' function to supervise business execution, the Company adopts a company with Nomination committee, etc., as its form of organization, that delegates business execution decisions to Executive Officers, allowing the Board of Directors to concentrate on monitoring and supervising execution and determining basic strategy. The Company has also established **["Corporate Governance Guidelines"](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/ir/corporate/esg/governance.html)** (Latest version: December 22, 2021) that form the framework of governance of the Company.

### Corporate Governance Structure

![](_page_65_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **State of Activities of the Board of Directors and Committees**

During the FY2021, the Board of Directors met 27 times, the Nomination Committee 20 times, the Audit Committee 13 times, the Compensation Committee 17 times and the Strategic Review Committee 20 times. The following outlines the Board of Directors' and committees' principal activities.

- The report of June 10, 2021 submitted by the persons who investigated the status of the operations and property of the stock company as set forth in Article 316, Paragraph 2 of the Companies Act indicates that, when compared to the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code, the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders for the 181st fiscal year held on July 31, 2020 cannot be said to have been conducted in a fair manner.
 With regard to the so-called Pressure Problem, in which external third parties also participated, it was determined that an objective, transparent, and exhaustive inquiry should be conducted into the real causes and facts of the matter to clarify the locus of responsibility and to put together measures to prevent a recurrence. To this end, a Governance Enhancement Committee was set up and commissioned to provide advice in relation to the

 State of activities of the Board of Directors causes of the problem, the clarification of responsibility, and measures to prevent a recurrence. The report compiled by this Committee was received on November 12, 2021.

- Based on the advice given in the above-mentioned Committee report, the Board of Directors and executives have held discussions and formulated measures to prevent a recurrence, focused on building healthy relationships of trust with shareholders, improving an organizational structure that is excessively reliant on government ministries and agencies, rebuilding of corporate governance, and practicing the correct "tone at the top."
- In June 2021, a Strategic Review Committee ("SRC") was set up, and worked to formulate business plans aimed at maximizing shareholder value. Over the course of approximately five months, the Company evaluated and considered various strate-

{66}------------------------------------------------

### **Compensation Policy**

### Compensation Policy

The Compensation Committee establishes compensation policy regarding compensation of each Director and/or Executive Officer. With respect to matters such as compensation for Company Directors and Executive Officers for the current fiscal year, the Compensation Committee has determined that the Company's method for determining compensation and the amount of compensation already determined are aligned with this policy.

The content of the policy concerning decision-making with regard to compensation, etc. for individual Company officers is as follows. Since the main responsibility of Directors is to supervise the execution of the overall Group's business, and increase the corporate value, the basic policy is to determine compensation for Directors by chiefly focusing on securing highly competent personnel, ensuring effective functioning of the supervisory function, and improving corporate value from a medium to long term perspective.

Since the main responsibility of Executive Officers is to increase corporate value in their capacity as executives responsible for companies or divisions within the Group, the Company has a basic policy to determine compensation for Executive Officers at an adequate level to secure highly competent personnel and ensure the effectiveness of their compensation package as an incentive to improve business performance, based on a balance between fixed compensation and performance-linked compensation. **1 Compensation for Directors**

- Directors are paid the Base salary (fixed amount) and the Committee Allowance (fixed amount) in accordance with the scope of their responsibilities. If multiple committees concurrently serve, the applicable Committee Allowances will be added up and paid. Directors who concurrently hold offices as an Executive Officer are paid only the compensation for Executive Officers specified in below and not paid compensation for Directors.
- The Base Salary and the Committee Allowance are paid by cash and shares of the Company at a prescribed rate.
- When traveling to attend a Meeting of the Board of Directors, Executive Session of the Board, or a Committee held in a non-resident country, the Attendance Allowance is paid according to the actual travel record.
- With regard to compensation paid by stock that is paid in the form of the Company's stock, mechanisms such as restricted stocks with transfer restrictions until retirement will be used.

#### **2 Compensation for Executive Officers**

- Compensation for Executive Officers consists of Base salary (fixed amount), determined according to rank, and performance-linked compensation.
- Performance-linked compensation is determined in accordance with the performance and medium to long term management indicators of the Company overall and the divisions under the charge of the Executive Officers during the fiscal year, with cash and stock of the Company paid at a rate set according to rank.
- The Base Salary and the Performance-linked compensation are paid by cash and shares of the Company at a prescribed rate.
- With regard to compensation paid by stock that is paid in the form of the Company's stock, mechanisms such as restricted stocks with transfer restrictions until retirement will be used to secure effectiveness as an incentive for medium- to long-term improvement of business performance.

#### **3 Compensation standards**

Compensation standards are determined at suitable levels as a global company, with the aim of securing highly competent management personnel suitable for managing Toshiba which is entering a period of change. The compensation standards of other listed companies and payroll and benefits are considered when determining the Company's compensation standards of management.

Compensation pertaining to the above is set as follows:

| Director          | Base salary + Committee Allowance + Attendance allowance for travel to non-resident countries |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Executive officer | Base salary + Performance-linked compensation (shares and cash)                               |

### **Policy on Risk Management and Compliance**

Toshiba Group has set up three lines of internal control system, with the relevant business divisions as the front line, the administrative divisions as the second, and the audit divisions as the third. The system is designed to effectively manage risks by assigning to each line a clearly defined role and set of duties, which it carries out appropriately, at the same time exercising a checks-and-balances function. In order to respond to changes in the business environment and to the diverse and ever-changing risks that arise when conducting business activities, we will ensure effective risk management.

Toshiba's shares were designated as securities on alert on September 15, 2015 due to inappropriate accounting. After that, Toshiba improved its internal control system and the designation was lifted on October 12, 2017. As reported in the Report on Improvements of Internal Management System and Progress Report on Improvements of Internal Management System released on October 20, 2017 and July 25, 2018 respectively, Toshiba has continued its efforts to strengthen the internal control system and worked to regain the trust of shareholders, investors, and all other stakeholders. On August 1, 2017, Toshiba's shares were reassigned to the Second Section of Tokyo Stock Exchange and Nagoya Stock Exchange. As a result of aforementioned efforts, our shares were designated as first section securities of both of the exchanges again on January 29, 2021. Toshiba will continue to work to enhance its internal control system.

At Toshiba Group, top management regularly issues messages on compliance so as to clarify its own stance and to foster a culture in which compliance is prioritized across the whole Group.

[Strategies](#page-13-0) [Business Results](#page-31-0) [Businesses](#page-35-0) [Sustainability](#page-46-0) [Data Section](#page-77-0)

At Toshiba Group, we formulated and are striving to entrench the **[Standards of Conduct for Toshiba Group (SOC)](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/sustainability/corporate/standards-of-conduct.html)** as a specific action guideline since we are a company that contributes to the realization of a sustainable society while conducting fair, sincere and highly transparent business activities. We are also working toward making the SOC an integral part of the entire Toshiba Group. The SOC is one of the Toshiba Group's important basic guidelines, and therefore, its revision requires approval by the Board of Directors.

Toshiba Group maintains a policy of zero tolerance against fraud, investigates all facts to identify the cause of any such occurrences, treats the facts seriously, makes every effort to prevent recurrence, and discloses information in a proper and timely manner as necessary. Any employees involved with cases of fraud are handled rigorously, including through the implementation of disciplinary action.

#### Structure of Risk Management and Compliance

Toshiba has separate management systems for compliance and other risks and business risks. Business risks refer to uncertain factors that may prevent the achievement of business and project objectives on strategic decision-making and execution of business activities.

To address compliance and other risks, we appoint a Chief Risk Compliance Management Officer (CRO) to oversee risk management and compliance for the whole Group. In addition, under the CRO, the Legal & Compliance Division responds to whistleblower reports, attempts to achieve global compliance, aims to strengthen the whistleblower system, and is advancing effective risk management and compliance activities.

The CRO chairs the Risk Compliance Committee, which is attended by executives in charge of corporate staff divisions. The committee analyzes whistleblower reports and cases both inside and outside the Company and evaluates the impacts of risks and the status of risk control in accordance with the risk table that covers compliance risks based on the **[Standards of Conduct for](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/sustainability/corporate/standards-of-conduct.html)  [Toshiba Group](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/sustainability/corporate/standards-of-conduct.html)**. It then determines priority measures of the immediate fiscal year. The Risk Compliance Committee is attended by members of the Audit Committee who also serve as directors. The agenda deliberated at the committee is reported to the Board of Directors.

In response to the inappropriate accounting treatment in 2015, Toshiba has worked to strengthen accounting compliance by establishing a special accounting compliance system. In order to further strengthen the overall compliance system, in FY2021, we evolved the system into one that encompasses accounting compliance and other types of compliance, and began promoting centralized management.

#### Risk Management and Compliance Committee

*1: The Risk Compliance Committee manages matters related to the Standards of Conduct for Toshiba Group and matters related to risk management and compliance. *2: CPL is an abbreviation combining CL (contractual liability) and PL (product liability).

{69}------------------------------------------------

Toshiba operates a risk management system (RMS) incorporating a PDCA cycle* led by administrative divisions at the second line of internal control system. The aim is to identify the status at each Toshiba Group company of initiatives on compliance risk and to promote improvement in an integrated manner. With the RMS, we implement the Risk Assessment Program (RAP) to assess risks of Toshiba Group companies. The administrative divisions provide guidance to improve the compliance risks identified. At the same time, the relevant business divisions at the front line of internal control system themselves work to identify and mitigate the risks autonomously.

Furthermore, since FY2020, we have systematically organized fraud risk scenarios related to financial reporting and accounting, and conducted inspections on Group companies to understand the status of their fraud risk, while strengthening guidance to improve such status.

In the event of a serious compliance-related incident, there is a system in place by which such incident is reported immediately to the President and CEO, CRO, and members of the Audit Committee, among others. A reporting system was also added in FY2021. Under these systems, the relevant in-house committees, etc. promptly evaluate and implement countermeasures.

Meanwhile, Toshiba deals with business risks by clarifying management decision criteria, permissible risk limits and corporate policy on business withdrawal in making management decisions for business execution to achieve Toshiba Group's sustainable growth and increase corporate value. In addition, for each risk case, the Business Risk Review Committee conducts risk assessment, identifies the maximum risk, and establishes items for monitoring.

* Plan: Identification and assessment of risks; Do: creation and operation of rules; Check: review and fact-finding surveys; Action: formulation and implementation of improvement plans

### Whistleblower System

In order to create an open work environment, Toshiba is enhancing its whistleblower system, on top of preventing risks by stimulating day-to-day communication in each workplace.

In January 2000, Toshiba established a whistleblower system Toshiba Hotline to collect internal information on SOC violations, particularly those concerning laws and regulations, and to deal with wrongdoing through a self-rectification system. Under this system, an employee can report an incident and seek advice via e-mail or phone. In April 2019, we transferred the function of receiving whistleblower reports to an external organization to further ensure anonymity, lower the hurdle of reporting to the hotline, and build a stronger sense of safety. E-mail support is available 24/7. In June 2022, we began accepting reports in English, targeting those employees at Toshiba Group companies in Japan who find it difficult to make the reports in the Japanese language. Also, a reception hotline was set up at an external attorney's office in January 2005, primarily to receive information about potential legal violations.

Furthermore, in October 2015, the new Audit Committee Hotline was set up, which allows people to report directly to the Audit Committee, which is composed of outside directors. With this new system, even matters in which the involvement of top management is suspected can be safely reported.

The Audit Committee also has access rights to the Toshiba Hotline, and provides appropriate guidance and supervision.

In April 2006, Toshiba set up a supplier whistleblower system Clean Partner Line to receive reports from suppliers and business partners to prevent SOC violations by employees in charge of procurement and order placements for construction and other works.

Each Toshiba Group company has its own whistleblower system. In addition, employees of the Toshiba Group in Japan can use the aforementioned Toshiba Hotline. Besides the whistleblower system at each company, in FY2021, we introduced the Toshiba Group Overseas Hotline for Toshiba Group companies overseas, by designating each Regional Representative Subsidiary as the secretariat for the corresponding region so as to cover laws and regulations and languages for different countries and regions.

At Toshiba Group, in accordance with laws, regulations, and internal regulations, officers and employees who make whistleblower reports with honest and legitimate intent do not receive unfavorable treatment such as dismissal and demotion as a result of having made the reports. Toshiba Group strives to ensure that the officers and employees can use the whistleblower system at ease. Specifically, each Group company has stipulated in its regulations a confidentiality obligation that allows limited persons in charge to access to what is reported by whistleblowers and a prohibition of unfavorable treatment of whistleblowers, as well as prepared manuals for persons in charge of whistleblowing. Toshiba Group in Japan maintains and operates a response system that complies with the amended Whistleblower Protection Act. We notified employees about the existence of the system and its assurance of strict anonymity through e-learning. We also reported on whistleblower cases to the whole Company on a number of occasions.

Of the reports received, Toshiba strived to investigate all facts on cases of possible legal violations or fraud to identify the cause, and handled such cases rigorously and imposed appropriate disciplinary sanctions on the offenders and implementing such measures to prevent recurrence. Meanwhile, the majority of the reports received were related to labor and general affairs. When a reported case was not a legal violation but there were or likely to be inappropriate situations, we provided instructions for improvement or issued alerts in cooperation with the relevant division. In cases involving consultations and questions about duties of the informants themselves, we gave advice on how to deal with the situation. For reports other than anonymous reports, we explained the status of our responses to the whistleblowers, in principle.

In accordance with laws, regulations, and internal regulations, confidential advisers (at the external organization or attorney's office for the Toshiba Hotline, and at the internal secretariat for the Audit Committee Hotline) never disclose the names or contact addresses of the informants, except in cases in which consent has been obtained from them.

Out of the whistleblower reports, cases that everyone should bear in mind are taught as part of employee training. In order to protect whistleblower anonymity, such cases are presented after they are anonymized, with some details changed so that the whistleblower and the workplace where they work cannot be identified. The number of reports received is released regularly on the company's internal website.

### **Business Risk Factors**

The Group's business areas of energy systems, infrastructure systems, building, retail & printing, devices & storage, and digital solutions require highly advanced technology for their operation. At the same time, the Group faces fierce global competition. Under such circumstances, major risk factors related to the Group recognized by the Company are described in **[Toshiba's Investor Relations website](https://www.global.toshiba/ww/ir/corporate/overview/risk.html?utm_source=www&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=since202203CorpIr)**. However, they should not be regarded as a complete and comprehensive statement of risk factors relating to the Group, and there are unforeseeable risk factors other than those described in said former website. The actual occurrence of any of those risk factors may adversely affect the Group's operating results and financial condition.

Further, the risks described in said former website are identified by the Group based on information that the Group has obtained as of June 27, 2022 (the date of submission annual securities report for the 183rd period), and involve inherent uncertainties, and, therefore, the actual results may differ.

{71}------------------------------------------------

### **Directors**

The Company is promoting various initiatives with the aim of expanding its Total Shareholder Return (TSR) through maximizing its corporate value.

Currently, of the twelve (12) Directors, ten (10) are Outside Directors and two (2) are Directors who also serve as Executive Officers. Outside Directors are the majority of the Board of Directors, in order to enhance the governance. In addition, including five (5) non-Japanese Outside Directors, the Board of Directors is composed of Directors with experience in international business, expertise in business portfolio management, business restructuring, M&A, capital markets and capital allocation, and deep knowledge in law and compliance, and the composition of directors could also reflect in management sufficient diversity viewpoints in terms of gender and international experience.

In deciding the candidates for Director, the Nomination Committee judged that the candidates conformed to the Director Nomination Criteria separately designated by the Nomination Committee and that the candidates had the appropriate qualifications for Director.
