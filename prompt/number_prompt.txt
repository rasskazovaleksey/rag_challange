Instructions:
1. Analyze the context and identify every instance of a number—whether presented as explicit digits (e.g., "123", "$1,000,000") or as textual references (e.g., "thousand", "million", "billion").
2. Convert each identified number to its pure decimal format by removing commas, symbols, or abbreviations. For example:
   - “122k” → “122000.0”
   - “10.0%” → “10.0”
   - “$1,000,000” → “1000000.0”
   - “3 thousand” → “3000.0”
3. If no relevant number is found, output "N/A".
4. Internally perform all necessary reasoning using a chain-of-thought process, but DO NOT reveal any internal chain-of-thought details in your final output.
5. Provide only the final answer with no additional text, disclaimers, or explanations.
