These groups include subject matter experts \\nalongside business leaders who will shape and drive \\nsustainable transformation across the global business. \\nAs a result of this work, we have been participating \\nin the SBTi net zero validation process and will be in \\na position to announce near-term and long-term net \\nzero targets alongside our transition plan in 2023. \\nWe do however understand that climate change will \\nnot wait and we must take action now. This was a key \\nmessage at COP27 in Egypt this year. As a result, we \\nhave set a carbon reduction target and made steady \\nprogress in 2022, as per the below summary.\\nTarget To reduce our scope 1, 2 and limited scope 3 emissions by 25% by 2024 (baseline year 2019).\\nProgress 44% reduction in emissions across scope 1, 2 and 3 since 2019. \\n2022 actions In 2022, we did see our carbon emissions increase by 94% YoY which was a direct result of Covid-19 \\nrestrictions being lifted. As we saw offices reopen, business meetings and business travel resume, we \\nhave recorded an increase in emissions YoY. However, the reductions we saw in 2021 were not reflective \\nof business as usual. We remained focused in 2022 on delivering the following operational changes to \\ntransition to net zero: \\n• Increased the amount of clean energy procured to 39% (2021: 38%).\\n• We reduced the use of natural gas across our offices by 42%.\\n• Reduced the emissions of our car fleet by 78%. \\n• Continued to improve our office selection criteria to prioritise green properties.\\n• Delivered 14 environmental awareness events to colleagues alongside weekly sustainability \\nconversations in some locations, to promote sustainable behaviours.\\n• Facilitated over 1,382 hours of volunteering at environmental projects to raise awareness and educate \\nour colleagues. \\n• Completed a single use plastic audit in the USA and began to implement plans to remove single use \\nplastic from the business.\\nThrough climate-related scenario analysis, we identified more opportunities than risks, in particular the \\nopportunities that arise from the role STEM skills will play in decarbonisation. Our scenario analysis highlighted \\na particular opportunity in the clean energy sector which has resulted in SThree setting a target and strategy to \\nmaximise this opportunity. \\nTarget To double the size of our clean energy business by 2024 (baseline year 2019).\\nProgress 88% growth in net fees since 2019.\\n2022 actions In 2022, our clean energy business grew by 29% YoY. To support the realisation of our clean energy target we:\\n• Delivered green careers upskilling events to 86 STEM professionals.\\n• Collaborated with a client to deliver green skills awareness events to 240 high school students.\\n• Partnered with Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable Energy (WRISE) on partnered events.\\nOur climate targets have been established to mitigate climate risk and maximise climate opportunities. KRI are in \\nplace as measures to monitor climate risks, these KRI are metrics which contribute to our overarching targets. As \\nan example our KRI to reduce the carbon emissions of car fleet is a sub-target and metric within our overarching \\ncarbon reduction target.\\nFurthermore, our focus on ESG matters is reflected through our remuneration policy with the weighting of \\nperformance measures adjusted to accommodate related targets. The resultant breakdown includes a 10% \\nweighting for ESG targets, including climate targets, as outlined in the KPI section of our Annual Report.\\nFurthermore, our focus on ESG matters is reflected through our remuneration policy with the weighting of Annual Report and Accounts 2022  P-77P-76  SThree plc sthree.com'),\n",

Regulatory compliance\\nRisk Description \\nA failure by the organisation to meet its regulatory obligations in respect of its business models could undermine our \\nreputation, might result in legal exposure and regulatory sanctions and could negatively impact our ability to operate. The \\nstaffing and recruitment industry sits against the backdrop of an increasingly stringent and complex regulatory environment. \\nThese regulatory changes bring commercial opportunities for SThree, as companies seek staffing models which remove both \\nthe burden of administration and the risk of regulatory non-compliance through engaging with companies such as SThree. \\nHowever, they also present risk to SThree in circumstances where we fail to manage those opportunities appropriately. \\nFailure to comply leaves SThree open to a range of risks, including fines, penalties, litigation, personal Director liability and \\nloss of licence to operate. Additionally, the reputational impact and loss of stakeholder confidence could undermine SThree’s \\nbusiness in its entirety.\\nMitigations \\n• Regular horizon scanning by Legal function with reporting to regional \\nmanagement boards and Executive Committee.\\n• Regional Legal team involvement in the establishment of new \\nproducts/services and entering new jurisdictions to ensure there is full \\nunderstanding of regulatory compliance required and the processes to \\nsupport the compliance.\\n• Local internal processes designed to ensure regulatory compliance  \\nfor each placement.\\n• Oversight of regulatory compliance risks and controls at Group  \\nRisk Committee.\\n• Regional regulatory compliance training rolled out by  \\nlegal department.\\n• Detailed regulatory risk assessments completed and regularly \\nreviewed for all business models in each country that the Company \\nhas an entity incorporated within, to ensure full understanding and \\nrelevant appropriate controls are in place.\\nChange from 2021\\nStable.

Effective strategic change management is inherently tied into the achievement of our strategy; change management \\nis required for the effective implementation of parts of the strategy that require us to operate differently.

The report provides underlying \\ndetail on the Committee and its activities during \\nthe year, in compliance with the UK Corporate \\nGovernance Code (the Code).\\nSThree’s purpose is to bring skilled people together \\nto build the future. That future-focus and long-\\nterm thinking also applies to how our Nomination \\nCommittee keeps our Board’s composition under \\nreview and ensures we have robust succession plans \\nin place, to safeguard the delivery of our strategy and \\nensure the long-term success of the Company.\\nSince my last report we have seen a number of \\nchanges to the composition of the Board. At the \\nstart of the year we announced that Mark Dorman \\nwould be stepping down from the Board and as CEO \\nof the Group on 31 December 2021. Timo Lehne \\nwas appointed interim CEO of the Group and the \\nCommittee commenced a search for a permanent \\nCEO. Having completed an extensive search process, \\nreviewing both internal and external candidates, \\nthe Committee recommended Timo for the role \\nas permanent CEO, with his appointment being \\nconfirmed on 28 April 2022. \\nThe Board understands and fully supports the \\nrecommendations of the Parker Review. However, \\nfollowing the very recent appointments, we plan to \\nallow a period of bedding in and Board stability for \\nour two new Non-Executive Directors and for the \\nBoard overall. We believe that this is also sensible \\nforward planning in terms of board succession and \\nrotation. Therefore we intend to look for an additional \\nNon-Executive Director, preferably from a non-\\nwhite minority ethic background, at some point in \\n2024 in order to meet the Parker Review target by \\nDecember\\xa02024.\\nSummary of Terms of Reference\\nThe Committee’s Terms of Reference are, broadly, to \\nregularly review the structure, size and composition \\n(including the skills, knowledge, experience and \\ndiversity) of the Board, make recommendations with \\nregard to any changes and to review and prepare \\nrelevant job descriptions for new appointees, as \\nwell as ensuring the continuing development of, and \\nadequate pipeline into, the Executive Committee for \\nsuccession and bench strength purposes.\\nSummary of core Committee activities \\ncarried out during the year:\\n• Oversaw the Board and senior management \\nsuccession plans.\\n• Oversaw the composition and effectiveness  \\nof the Board and Committees, with diversity  \\na key\\xa0criteria.\\n• Oversaw the search for a new Chief  \\nExecutive Officer. \\n• Oversaw the search for, and recommended the \\nappointment of, two new independent Non-\\nExecutive Directors, including the Chair of the \\nAudit & Risk Committee.\\nSuccession planning and diversity\\nAs discussed above, Mark Dorman stepped down as \\nCEO in December 2021. The Committee oversaw an \\ninternal and external search for a new CEO, leading to \\nthe appointment of Timo Lehne, first as interim CEO \\nand subsequently as permanent CEO. Following the \\nresignation of Anne Fahy as a Non-Executive Director \\nin April this year the Committee accelerated its search \\nfor new Directors, leading to the appointment of Elaine \\nO’Donnell and Imogen Joss.\\nDenise Collis continues to act as the designated \\nNED responsible for employee engagement and to \\nunderstand and represent the views of employees at \\nBoard level. Denise has attended a number of focus \\ngroups with a wide range of employees during the year, \\ntogether with other Board members. These focus groups \\nhave discussed subjects such as executive remuneration, \\ndiversity and inclusion, and health and wellbeing.\\nThe Committee also periodically reviews Board \\ncomposition to ensure that the Code provisions \\nregarding diversity, over-boarding, Chair tenure and \\nRemuneration Committee Chair experience are all \\ncomplied with. In November 2022 the Committee \\nconsidered Board membership and the need to \\ncontinually refresh the composition of the Board on a \\ngradual basis, taking into account the length of service \\nof current Board members.\\nLast year we reported that the Committee had agreed \\nplans to achieve a Board, by 2024, with a minimum of \\n40% female representation and at least one individual \\nfrom a non-white minority ethnic background. I am \\ndelighted to report that we now have in excess of 40% \\nfemale representation on the Board, in accordance \\nwith the FCA’s Board diversity targets. Denise Collis \\nwho is our Senior Independent Director, is considered \\nto hold a senior Board position. \\nIt remains the Committee’s intention to add one \\nadditional Non-Executive Director, preferably from \\na non-white minority ethnic background, before \\nDecember 2024. The Committee acknowledges the \\nimportance of diversity in its broadest sense in the \\nboardroom. In filling this position, consideration will be \\ngiven to the combination of demographics, experience, \\nskills, race, age, gender, education and professional \\nbackground and other personal objectives needed \\nto support good decision making. The Committee \\nis mindful of the need to devote time to thoroughly \\nembedding each new Non-Executive Director and to \\ncreating a cohesive Board. The timing of onboarding \\nof a new Non-Executive Director will therefore be \\ncarefully assessed. \\nSelection and appointment of a \\nnew Chief Executive Officer\\nFollowing the announcement of the departure \\nof Mark Dorman as Chief Executive Officer, \\nTimo Lehne was, on the recommendation of \\nthe Nomination Committee, appointed as \\nan Executive Director and interim CEO. An \\nextensive and thorough search process then \\ncommenced. Russell Reynolds Associates, a \\nleading executive search firm, was engaged \\nto facilitate the process, which involved a \\ndiverse longlist of potential candidates, drawn \\nfrom a range of backgrounds and including \\nboth internal and external candidates. Russell \\nReynolds Associates has no other connection \\nwith the Company or its individual Directors \\naside from the provision of recruitment services. \\nFollowing interviews with and full evaluation \\nof selected candidates, the Nomination \\nCommittee endorsed the appointment of \\nTimo Lehne as the permanent Chief Executive \\nOfficer. Having previously been SThree’s \\nmost experienced Managing Director from \\nour largest region, Timo had demonstrated \\nstrategic thinking, drive, commerciality and \\npeople-leadership skills both in that role and \\nas Interim CEO and was well placed to lead \\nthe Group. Timo then received a tailored \\ninduction programme, which given his in-\\ndepth knowledge of the Group and the market, \\nconcentrated on the legal framework governing \\nthe duties of a director of a listed company, and \\ncontinuing obligations. \\n Annual Report and Accounts 2022  P-137P-136 SThree plc  sthree.com'),\n",

The directors are also responsible for such \\ninternal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s \\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the \\ngoing concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to \\ncease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nAuditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. \\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \\nwith ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud \\nor error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in \\nline with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including \\nfraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance \\nwith laws and regulations related to employment laws and indirect taxes impacting the different territories in which \\nthe group operates, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the \\nfinancial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial \\nstatements such as the Companies Act 2006 and Listing Rules. We evaluated management’s incentives and \\nopportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), \\nand determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to achieve desired \\nfinancial results and management bias in accounting estimates. Audit procedures performed by the engagement \\nteam\\xa0included:\\n• enquiries with management, internal audit, the Audit and Risk committee and the group’s internal legal \\ncounsel, including consideration of known or suspected instances of fraud and non-compliance with laws \\nand regulations and performed testing where a provision has been made in respect of these by examining \\nsupporting calculations;\\n• understanding and evaluating the design and implementation of management’s controls designed to prevent \\nand detect irregularities;\\n• challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in \\nparticular in relation to accrued income cut-off, assessment of impairment for investments in subsidiaries; and\\n• identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account \\ncombinations and postings by unusual users.\\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of \\ninstances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions \\nreflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher \\nthan the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for \\nexample, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using \\ndata auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than \\ntesting complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk \\ncharacteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population \\nfrom which the sample is selected.\\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website \\nat: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.\\nUse of this report\\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in \\naccordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving \\nthese opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is \\nshown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\\nOther required reporting\\nCompanies Act 2006 exception reporting\\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\\n• we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\\n• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not \\nbeen received from branches not visited by us; or\\n• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or\\n• the company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in \\nagreement with the accounting records and returns.\\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\\nAppointment\\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee, we were appointed by the members in 1999 to \\naudit the financial statements for the year ended 30 November 1999 and subsequent financial periods.

The assets of the schemes are held separately from \\nthose of the Group in independently administered funds. The pension costs charged to the income statement \\nrepresent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.\\nShare-based payments\\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based arrangements, under which it receives services \\nfrom employees in return for equity instruments of the Group. The cost of equity-settled transactions with \\nemployees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date when equity instruments are granted and is \\nrecognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully \\nentitled to the award. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate valuation model.\\nNo expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. For the awards with non-vesting conditions \\n(awards that do not have an explicit or implicit service requirement), the full cost of the award is recognised on \\nthe grant date, i.e. they are treated as fully vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied.\\nAt the end of the reporting period, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the \\nvesting period has expired and the best estimate of the achievement of non-market conditions and the number \\nof equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous year end \\nis recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding credit recognised in equity.\\nWhere an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any \\ncost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation \\npaid, up to the fair value of the award, at the cancellation or settlement date, is deducted from equity, with any \\nexcess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.\\n3  Administrative expenses  continued\\n(b) Profit for the prior year included the following items that were unusual because of their nature, \\nsize or incidence:\\nAccounting policy\\nExceptional items\\nExceptional items, as disclosed on the face of the income statement, are items which due to their size and non-\\nrecurring nature are classified separately in order to draw them to the attention of the reader of the financial \\nstatements and to provide an alternative performance measure (APM) of the underlying profits of the Group.\\nGovernment grant income\\nGovernment grants represent assistance by government in the form of transfers of resources to SThree in return \\nfor compliance with grant conditions.\\nA government grant is recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with any \\nconditions attached to the grant and that the grant will be received.

Taxable profit differs from profit before income \\ntax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable \\nor deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.

The maximum exposure to a single banking group for deposits and funds held on account at the year end \\nwas £40.6 million (2021: £43.5 million). The Group will not accept any counterparty bank for its deposits unless it \\nhas been awarded a minimum recognised credit rating of A3/Prime-2 (Moody’s). Some local banks in emerging \\nmarkets may have lower ratings but the funds at risk will be small. The Group will permit exposures with individual \\ncounterparty banks and exposure types up to pre-defined limits as part of the Group treasury policy. Exposure to \\nall transaction limits is monitored daily.\\nThe Group mitigates its credit risk from trade receivables by using a credit rating agency to assess new clients and \\npayment history to consider further credit extensions to existing clients. In addition, the spread of the client base \\n(over 8,200 clients) helps to mitigate the risk of individual client failure having a material impact on the Group.\\nThe Group does not typically renegotiate the terms of trade receivables; hence the outstanding balance is included \\nin the analysis based on the original payment terms. There were no significant renegotiated balances outstanding \\nat the year end.\\nThe Group’s credit risk from loans given to certain tracker shareholders (note 13) is immaterial. In 2022, five loans \\nwere repaid in full, and only three remain outstanding (2021: eight outstanding tracker share loans) for the total \\namount of £0.1 million. Exposure to loans from individuals is regularly monitored and the individuals are asked \\nto settle all or a portion of their outstanding balances when their tracker shares are settled, when they receive \\ndividends or if they leave the business.\\nClimate-related matters\\nIn the current year, the management team continued to monitor and mitigate any potential deterioration in clients’ \\ncredit risk, in particular for a small proportion of the Group’s clients which are exposed to physical and transition \\nrisks associated with climate change. No material financial impact or deterioration in our clients’ ability to settle \\ntheir debt obligations was identified.\\nIn the near future, in line with the Group’s climate change strategy, the management team has plans to establish \\ncredit rating/scoring matrix which will help us to assess how our clients address ESG matters within their \\norganisations, and whether their policies meet our standards and risk appetite.\\n24 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued\\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to owners of the parent of £200.4 million \\n(2021:\\xa0£158.2 million), comprising share capital, share premium, other reserves and retained earnings as disclosed \\nin the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and net cash of £65.4 million (2021: £57.5 million), comprising \\ncash and cash equivalents less bank overdraft (note 14).\\nExcept for compliance with certain bank covenants (note 24(c)), the Group is not subject to any externally imposed \\ncapital requirements.\\n(b) Foreign currency exchange risk management \\nThe Group uses Sterling as its presentation currency. It undertakes transactions in a number of foreign currencies. \\nConsequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations do arise. Such exchange rate movements affect the \\nGroup’s transactional revenues, cost of sales, the translation of earnings and the net assets/liabilities of its \\noverseas\\xa0operations.\\nThe Group is also exposed to foreign currency risks from the value of net investments outside the United Kingdom. \\nThe intercompany loans which are treated as net investments in foreign operations are not planned to be settled in \\nthe foreseeable future as they are deemed to be a part of the investment. Therefore, exchange differences arising \\nfrom the translation of the net investment loans are taken into equity.\\nThe Group’s businesses generally raise invoices and incur expenses in their local currencies. Local currency cash \\ngenerated is remitted via intercompany transfers to the United Kingdom. The Group generally converts foreign \\ncurrency balances into Sterling to manage its cash flows.\\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis\\nThe Group is mainly exposed to the Euro and the US Dollar. If the Euro or the US Dollar strengthened against \\nSterling by a movement of 10%, the anticipated impact on the Group’s results in terms of translational exposure \\nwould be an increase in profit before income tax of £6.9 million and £3.4 million (2021: £7.0 million and £3.1 million) \\nrespectively, with a similar decrease if the Euro or the US Dollar weakened against Sterling by 10%. \\n(c) Liquidity risk management\\nThe Group’s treasury function centrally coordinates relationships with banks, manages borrowing requirements, \\nforeign exchange needs and cash management. The Group has access to a committed RCF of £50.0 million along \\nwith an uncommitted £30.0 million accordion facility in place with HSBC and Citibank, giving the Group an option \\nto increase its total borrowings under the facility to £80.0 million. At the year end, £nil (2021: £nil) was drawn down \\non these facilities. The Group also has an uncommitted £5.0 million overdraft facility with HSBC of which £0.4 \\nmillion was used at the year end.\\nThe RCF is subject to certain covenants requiring the Group to maintain financial ratios over interest cover, leverage \\nand guarantor cover. The Group complied with these covenants throughout the year.\\n(i)  Interest cover: interest cover shall not be less than the ratio of 4:1 at any time;\\n(ii)  Leverage: the ratio of total net debt on the last day of a period to the adjusted EBITDA in respect of that period \\nshall not exceed the ratio of 3:1; and\\n(iii)  Guarantor cover: the aggregate adjusted EBITDA and gross assets of all the guarantor subsidiaries must at all \\ntimes represent at least 80% of the adjusted EBITDA and gross assets of the Group as a whole.\\nNotes to the financial statements continued\\nfor the year ended 30 November 2022\\n Annual Report and Accounts 2022  P-237P-236 SThree plc sthree.com\"),\n",
