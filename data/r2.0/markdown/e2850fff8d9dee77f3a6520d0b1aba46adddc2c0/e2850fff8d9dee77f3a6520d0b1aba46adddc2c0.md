#### Dear Shareholders

The 2022 financial year was a challenging year for global markets. The BHD portfolio was impacted by the general instability in the market driven by inflation concerns, tensions in Ukraine and the flow on effects from these events to markets globally. Equity markets were displaying signs of overvaluation, especially in the tech and unlisted space which was probably a reflection more of overvaluation driven by unsustainably low interest rates following on from Covid-19 measures put in place by Central Banks to minimise the damage to their economies as the world went into lockdown. That overreaction forced asset prices higher and at the first sign of a shift back to interest rate normalisation we are experiencing a winding back of asset prices. The upside of this pullback in asset prices is that we see more value in the equity market and the potential for strong returns with many companies now at oversold levels.

We have focused on investing in lower-risk situations as a means to generate returns while limiting downside, though these investments were not immune to a global sell-off in risk assets and still have risk and correlation with equity markets. Over the year BHD's investment portfolio generated a gross return of (-5.97%) gross of dividends and franking. This compares with the S&P/ASX 200 Accumulation Index return of (-6.47%) and the S&P/ASX Small Ordinaries Accumulation Index return of (-19.5%).

We expect to continue with the same strategy, preserving capital and at the same time providing us with sufficient capital to fund ongoing legal matters while pursuing recovery of loans owed to the company. While these loans have been impaired, they still remain outstanding and your Directors are of the opinion that we will recover additional funds for investors in pursuing these debts.

In regards to the outcome of the various legal matters before the company, the process has been significantly slower than we anticipated as we await the outcome of various other actions being undertaken by Administrators, ASIC and Insurance Companies. Notably, the recent judgement to wind up Henry Morgan Ltd provided significant findings from the Federal Court and likely to provide tailwinds for our claims.

The Company experienced some small wins in the financial in relation to clawing back funds for shareholders. We received a small insurance payout over the period over \$116k.

As a final point, your Directors have all backed the company, now owning over 30% of the issued capital. We have returned the shares to trading on the ASX, providing liquidity for shareholders who wish to sell and still remain committed to maximising the potential for shareholders from our impaired loans and other claims.

Stay safe, stay well

Gary, Michael & Sulieman

#### *Shareholders AGM votes on the 2021 Remuneration Report*

The Company received 45.57% 'yes' poll votes on the adoption of the Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2021. As more than 25% of Shareholders voted 'no' the Company has received a 'first strike'; as a result, the Annual General Meeting will include a Conditional Spill Resolution to address this issue.

#### *Remuneration framework*

The objective of the Company's remuneration framework is to align KMP objectives with shareholder and business objectives by providing fixed remuneration to Board members. The Board of the Company believes the remuneration framework to be appropriate and effective in its ability to attract and retain high-quality KMP to run and manage the Company, as well as creating an alignment of interests between Directors and shareholders.

The Board's policy for determining the nature and amount of remuneration for KMP of the Company is as follows:

- The remuneration arrangements are developed and approved by the Board.
- Non-Executive Directors do not receive performance-related remuneration and are not entitled to participate in equity-based incentive plans in the Company.
- All KMP receive a fixed Director's fee which is based on factors such as relevant industry standards.
- The Board reviews KMP remuneration arrangements periodically by reference to the Company's performance and comparable information from industry sectors.

Total remuneration available to the Directors for their services as Directors is a maximum of \$450,000. Any increase in the aggregate amount of Directors' fees over \$450,000 must be approved by a resolution of the shareholders.

The Board's policy is to remunerate non-executive Directors at market rates for time, commitment and responsibilities. Independent external advice is sought when required.

In addition, the Company's Securities Trading policy prohibits Directors and KMP from using the Company's securities as collateral in any financial transaction, including margin loan arrangements.

{9}------------------------------------------------

#### *Performance-based remuneration*

There is currently no performance-based remuneration paid directly by the Company. Measures may be specifically tailored in the future.

#### *Relationship between remuneration policy and Company performance*

The remuneration framework has been tailored to align the goals ofshareholders, Directors and executives. The Company commenced operations in May 2017 and remuneration will be reviewed regularly in the context of the framework outlined above, including reference to Company performance. The Company believes this framework will be effective in increasing shareholder wealth.

#### **Performance conditions linked to remuneration**

There are currently no performance conditions linked to KMP remuneration.

The investment objective of the Company is to achieve moderate to high portfolio returns over the medium to long term.

The Company was incorporated on 28 September 2016 and commenced operations on 11 May 2017.

The Company is a for-profit entity and these financial statements have been prepared using historical cost basis. The Company is an investment company and accounts for investments at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with AASB 9 *Financial Instruments* and AASB 10 *Consolidated Financial Statements.*

The financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the *Corporations Act 2001*. The financial report complies with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.

All amounts have been rounded to the nearest whole dollar unless otherwise stated.

The financial statements were authorised by the Board of Directors on 29 August 2022.

#### **Note 2. Significant accounting policies**

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out either in the respective notes or below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

#### **New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted**

Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the Company for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2022. The Company's assessment of the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations and there is no material impact.

#### **Basis of preparation**

#### *Critical accounting estimates*

The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 3.

#### **Investments and other financial assets**

Investments and other financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs are included as part of the initial measurement, except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. They are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value depending on their classification. Classification is determined based on the purpose of the acquisition and subsequent reclassification to other categories is restricted.

{19}------------------------------------------------

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

#### *Investments at fair value through profit or loss*

Investments at fair value through profit or loss are either:

- (i) held for trading, where they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the short-term with an intention of making a profit; or
- (ii) designated as such upon initial recognition, where they are managed on a fair value basis or to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch. Except for effective hedging instruments, derivatives are also categorised as fair value through profit or loss. Fair value movements are recognised in profit or loss.

#### **Loans**

Loans are financial assets initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and fees. Loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method where there have been contractual cashflows which represent solely payment of principal and interest ('SPPI') on the principal balance outstanding and they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved through holding loans to collect these cashflows.

#### *Impairment of financial assets*

At the end of each reporting period, an assessment is made as to the extent of any expected credit losses ('ECLs') impacting on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. Expected credit losses may arise where there are indications that the counterparty is experiencing significant financial difficulty or might enter insolvency proceedings or other financial reorganisation, where there has been a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, or where changes in economic conditions have occurred impacting on the likelihood of defaults.

Interest earned on these balances is presented on a net basis in the income statement as this reflects how the customer is charged.

#### **Profit reserve**

A profit reserve has been created representing an amount allocated from current period earnings that is preserved for future dividend payments.

#### **Dividends**

Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared on fully paid ordinary shares, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

In accordance with the *Corporation Act 2001*, the Company may pay a dividend where the Company's assets exceed its liabilities, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the Company's shareholders as a whole and the payment of the dividend does not materially prejudice the Company's ability to pay its creditors.

#### **Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and within the next financial year are discussed below.

{20}------------------------------------------------

#### *Fair value measurement hierarchy*

The Company is required to classify all assets and liabilities, measured at fair value, using a three level hierarchy, based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the entire fair value measurement, being: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Considerable judgement is required to determine what is significant to fair value and therefore which category the asset or liability is placed in can be subjective.

The fair value of regularly traded quoted instruments is based on current market prices, otherwise management make an assessment on the bid ask spread of the share price and will use a value within that range. The fair value of privately held investments (and instruments that are linked to their value) which are not currently traded in the public market are estimated using valuation techniques, such as the Income Approach, the Market Approach and the Cost Approach; these valuation approaches are included in Level 3 of the hierarchy. Factors considered in determining the fair value of these investments include, but are not limited to, market conditions, purchase price, nature of investment, estimation of liquidity value, subsequent third-party equity financing or significant change in operating performance or potential resulting in a change in valuation, and other pertinent information. Refer to Note 9 for further information.

#### *Allowance for expected credit losses*

The allowance for expected credit losses assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based on the lifetime expected credit loss, grouped based on days overdue, and makes assumptions to allocate an overall expected credit loss rate for each group. These assumptions include recent sales experience, historical collection rates, the impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and forwardlooking information that is available. The allowance for expected credit losses, as disclosed in Note 10, is calculated based on the information available at the time of preparation. The actual credit losses in future years may be higher or lower.

#### *Recovery of deferred tax assets*

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and tax losses only if the Company considers it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

#### *Estimated fair values of level 2 and level 3 investments*

The Company carries its investments at fair value with changes in the fair values recognised in Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. At the end of each reporting period, the Directors update their assessment of the fair value of securities which are categorised under level 2 and level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 6 for information on level 2 and level 3 securities.

#### *Impact of COVID-19 pandemic*

Judgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had, or may have, on the operations of the Company and its financial position and results. During the financial year there has been no significant impact upon the financial results and position of the Company reported on in these financial statements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### **Note 4. Operating segments**

Operating segments are identified based on the financial information periodically reviewed by the Board (representing the Chief Operating Decision Maker) in assessing the performance and determining the allocation of resources. As the Company operates in only one segment, all results presented in this financial report relate to the financial services segment.

The Company operates materially in only one geographical segment being Australia.

#### (a) Refer to Notes 9 and 10 for further detail.

- (b) Cost recoveries
During the year the Company recovered \$139,268 of legal costs from insurers and a prior related party. In previous year, the Company announced on 17 July 2020 that the company recovered \$120,467 from John Bridgeman Ltd (JBL) in respect of Takeover Panel costs following orders made by the Supreme Court of Queensland. In addition, \$5,412 of costs were recovered from Peter Aardoom in respect of overpayment of director fees and associated recovery costs.

#### *Accounting policy for revenue recognition*

Revenue is recognised at the transaction price specified in the contract and excludes any taxes collected on behalf of third parties.

#### *Net gains / (losses) on investments*

Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of investments held are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

#### *Government grants*

Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the profit or loss over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.

#### *Foreign currency gains / (losses)*

Foreign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.

#### *Dividends*

Dividends and distributions are brought into account on the dates that the securities trade ex-dividends. Demerger dividends arising form company de-consolidations are treated as a return of capital and not as a dividend.

{22}------------------------------------------------

#### *Interest income*

Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument) to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

#### **Note 6. Fair value measurement**

#### *Fair value hierarchy*

The following tables detail the Company's assets and liabilities, measured or disclosed at fair value, using a three-level hierarchy, based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the entire fair value measurement, being:

- Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.
- Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

There were no transfers between levels during the financial year.

The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.

#### *Accounting policy for fair value measurement*

When an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.

Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, are used, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

#### **Note 7. Income tax**

The income tax expense for the period comprises current income tax expense and deferred tax expense/(benefit).

Current income tax expense charged to profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income. Current tax liabilities/(assets) are measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/ (recovered from) the relevant taxation authority.

Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the period as well as unused tax losses.

Current and deferred income tax expense/(benefit) is charged or credited outside profit or loss when the tax relates to items that are recognised outside profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled and their measurement also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for:

- When the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future; or
- When the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits.

{24}------------------------------------------------

Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where: (a) a legally enforceable right of set-off exists; and (b) the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.

#### **Deferred tax**

In line with our existing accounting policy, the Company has exercised judgement in determining the extent of recognition of deferred tax balances. The Company does not consider it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and as a result no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

#### **Tax losses**

#### (i) JBL Loan

On 2 August 2018 the Company made a loan of \$1,134,154 to JBL for an initial term of one year at 11.5% per annum interest. On 16 October 2018 the term of the loan was extended to 8 February 2020. On 12 February 2020 \$149,548 of the JBL loan was repaid by JBL complying with orders made in the Supreme Court of Queensland on 4 February 2020.

{27}------------------------------------------------

For the year ended 30 June 2022 \$140,813 (2021: \$125,583) of interest has been recognised, all of which was receivable at 30 June 2022 (2021: \$125,583). No interest repayments have been received since December 2018 and as a result the loan is in default. An impairment charge of \$140,813 has been recognised in the current year (2021: \$125,583).

#### (ii) JBFG Loan

In July 2018, the Company entered into a short-term loan agreement with Genesis for \$800,000 at 9% per annum repayable in October 2018. On 24 December 2018, the Company extended the loan agreement with Genesis to a maturity date of 31 October 2019. On 7 May 2019, the loan plus interest totalling \$857,995 was assigned from Genesis to JBFG.

For the year ended 30 June 2022 \$97,667 (2021: \$89,293) of interest has been recognised. An impairment provision of \$97,667 (2021: \$89,293) has been recognised in the current year as repayment of the loan plus interest. As repayment was not made on 31 October 2019, the loan is in default.

#### *Accounting policy for trade and other receivables*

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the expected credit loss (ECL) method. The Company calculated the provisions for ECL based on a threestage approach. ECL are a probability- weighted estimate of the cash shortfalls expected to result from defaults over the relevant timeframe under AASB 9 *Financial Instruments*. They are determined by revaluation a range of possible outcomes, taking into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecast economic conditions. The model uses three main components to determine the ECL including:

- Probability of default (PD) the probability that the counterparty will default,
- Loss given default (LGD) the loss that is expected from the default event,
- Exposure to default (EAD) the estimated outstanding amount of credit exposure at the time of default.

The three ECL stages are:

- 1. 12 months ECL performing
For financial assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since origination, a provision for 12 months ECL is recognised.

- 2. Lifetime ECL performing For financial assets where there is a significant increase in credit risk since origination but the assets are still performing, a provision for lifetime ECL is recognised.
- 3. Lifetime ECL non-performing For financial assets where there is a significant increase in credit risk since origination but the assets are not performing due to default, a provision for lifetime ECL is recognised.

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on the winding up of the Company in proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the shares held. The fully paid ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have a limited amount of authorised capital.

Fully paid ordinary shares carry one vote per share and carry the rights to dividends.

#### *Options on issue*

At 30 June 2022, nil (2021: nil) options are on issue. During the year nil (2021: nil) options have been exercised.

#### *Capital risk management*

The Company's objectives when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimum capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Capital is regarded as total equity, as recognised in the statement of financial position, plus net debt. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

{29}------------------------------------------------

The Company would look to raise capital when an opportunity to invest in a business or company was seen as value adding relative to the current Company's share price at the time of the investment.

The capital risk management policy remains unchanged from the prior Annual Report.

#### *Accounting policy for issued capital* Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

#### **Note 13. Dividends**

#### *Dividends*

There were no dividends paid during the financial year (2021: \$nil).

#### *Accounting policy for dividends*

Dividends are recognised when declared during the financial year and no longer at the discretion of the Company.

#### **Note 14. Financial instruments**

#### *Financial risk management objectives*

This note presents information about the Company's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.

The Company's operational investing activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The oversight and management of the Company's risk management program has been conferred upon the Board of Directors. The Board is responsible for reviewing that the Company maintains effective risk management and internal control systems and processes.

#### *Market Risk*

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices and credit spreads.

#### *Price risk*

Market prices fluctuate due to a range of factors specific to the individual investments or factors affecting the market in general. Price risk exposure arose from the Company's open derivative positions.

The Investment Manager's investment decision process is fundamental to the management of price risk. The Investment Manager undertakes extensive assessment of market dynamics, considers the impact of key events, changes in leading indicators as well as market extremes before investing, investing further capital or exiting investments.

{30}------------------------------------------------

#### *Price risk sensitivity analysis*

As at 30 June 2022 an increase of 5% (2021: 5%) in market prices applicable at the reporting date would have increased the Company's profit and net assets by \$305,777 (2021: \$313,414). A decrease of 5% in market prices would have an equal and opposite effect. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.

The sensitivity level demonstrated each year depends on the specific derivative contract open positions held at the balance date. The level is based on the initial margin percentage required to buy the derivative positions. The initial margin percentage requirement is considered to be a fair indicator of the perceived volatility of the derivative.

#### *Interest rate risk*

The Company is not exposed to any significant interest rate risk in respect of financial assets and liabilities.

#### *Credit risk*

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company. The Company obtains guarantees where appropriate to mitigate credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements. The Company does not hold any collateral.

Cash and balances held with brokers are held with highly rated Australian retail banks and trading activities are conducted through stockbrokers. Cash holdings are categorised as follows:

| Risk Rating | 2022      | 2021      |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
|             | \$        | \$        |
| A+          | 1,334,867 | 2,010,830 |
| Unrated     | 10        | 10        |
|             |           |           |

**1,337,877** 2,010,840

The maximum exposure to credit risk for derivatives is any unrealised profit and margins paid on the positions that the Company held at the reporting date. The credit risk exposure for cash and deposit holdings is the carrying amount at the reporting date.

At 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021, receivables were neither past due nor impaired, unless stated so in this report.

#### *Liquidity risk*

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.

The following table summarises the contractual maturity of the Company's financial liabilities at the reporting date:

|                       | Carrying<br>amount | Contractual<br>cash flow | At call | 6 months or<br>less |

#### *Fair value of financial instruments*

Unless otherwise stated, the carrying amounts of financial instruments reflects their fair value.

#### **Note 15. Key management personnel disclosures**

#### *Directors*

Short term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a legal obligation or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be measured reliably. If benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date, then they are discounted.

Refer to the remuneration report for details of the remuneration paid or payable to each member of the Company's key management personnel (KMP) for the period ended 30 June 2022.

The total remuneration paid to KMP of the Company during the period is as follows:

#### *Accounting policy for earnings per share*

#### Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Benjamin Hornigold Ltd, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year.

#### Diluted earnings per share

There are no instruments excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future because they are anti-dilutive for both periods presented. There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares that would significantly change the number of ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares outstanding between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements.

#### **Note 18. Contingent liabilities**

The Company has no contingent liabilities at 30 June 2022 or 30 June 2021.

#### **Note 19. Related party transactions**

#### *Transactions with related parties include:*

- A. The compensation arrangements with the Directors'; *Key management personnel* Disclosures relating to key management personnel are set out in Note 15 and the remuneration report included in the Directors' report.

- C. Sulieman Ravell via a related trust, is a shareholder of Wealth Focus Pty Ltd, which received \$nil (2021: \$2,000 plus GST) in allocating stock under a public offer to Benjamin Hornigold Ltd.

#### **Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Benjamin Hornigold Ltd**

#### **Report on the Audit of the Financial Report**

#### *Opinion*

We have audited the financial report of Benjamin Hornigold Ltd ("the Company"), which comprises the statement of financial position as at 30 June 2022, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes to the financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies, and the directors' declaration.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of Benjamin Hornigold Ltd, is in accordance with the *Corporations Act 2001*, including:

- (a) giving a true and fair view of the Company's financial position as at 30 June 2022 and of its financial performance for the year then ended; and
- (b) complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the *Corporations Regulations 2001*.

#### *Basis for Opinion*

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the *Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report* section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the *Corporations Act 2001* and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 *Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards)* "the Code" that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We confirm that the independence declaration required by the *Corporations Act 2001*, which has been given to the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor's report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

#### *Key Audit Matters*

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

#### **Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

#### **Valuation of financial assets**

#### **Refer to Note 9**

The Company invests in various financial instruments exposing it to a number of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

As at 30 June 2022, financial assets totalled \$6,115,535 (2021: \$6,268,287) and include listed and unlisted securities at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets at fair value through profit of loss are classified according to the fair value hierarchy within AASB 13 *Fair Value Measurement* as follows:

- Level 1 (i.e. inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets);
- Level 2 (i.e. inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly); or
- Level 3 (i.e. inputs are unobservable) represented by convertible loan note which has been fully impaired as at balance date.

This is assessed as a key audit matter due to the significance of the balance, representing 79% of total assets and the most significant driver of the Company's Net Tangible Assets and Profits.

Our procedures included, amongst others:

- Obtaining an understanding of the design and implementation of the relevant controls associated with the acquisition and valuation of financial assets.
- Obtaining supporting documentation to confirm the quantity of shares held at the reporting date.
- Agreeing the valuation of listed securities to their quoted market value at the reporting date.
- Recalculating the fair value gain or loss recognised in the profit or loss arising from the mark to market adjustments at the reporting date.
- Recalculating interest accrued on convertible notes and ensuring it is in accordance with the contractual terms of the note deed.
- Assessing the disclosure of the quantitative and qualitative considerations when determining the fair value hierarchy in the financial report of the Company in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.

#### *Other Information*

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Operating Financial Report, the Company's Director's, Corporate Governance Statement and ASX Information which was obtained as at the date of our audit report, and any additional other information that will be included in the Company's annual report for the year ended 30 June 2022, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

{37}------------------------------------------------

#### *Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report*

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the *Corporations Act 2001*  and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

#### *Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report*

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
