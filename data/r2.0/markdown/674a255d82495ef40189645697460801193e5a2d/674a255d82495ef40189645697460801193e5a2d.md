# **Statement from the Board**

On behalf of the Board, I hereby present to the shareholders the results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022 ("**FY2022**").

### **RESULTS**

For FY2022, the Group continued to principally engage in the business of petroleum exploration and production, solar energy, money leading and investment in securities.

During FY2022, there was a sharp surge in international oil prices largely because of the revival of economic activities worldwide following the easing of the COVID pandemic, and the tightened supply of energy sources following the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine. The price of Brent crude oil, one of the benchmarks of international oil prices, jumped from around US\$80 per barrel in December 2021, reached its peak of over US\$130 per barrel in March 2022, and dropped back to around US\$80 per barrel in December 2022. Although international oil prices continue to fluctuate considerably recently, they are hovering at comparatively high levels to their historical trends in the past five years and current market outlook of the industry remains positive.

Leveraging on the Group's business experience of its oil operation in Argentina and with the intent of continuing its petroleum exploration and production business, as announced by the Company on 17 July 2022, the Group has completed the acquisition of an operating oil field which comprises petroleum and natural gas rights, facilities and pipelines, together with all other properties and assets located in Alberta Province of Canada (the "**Canadian Oil Assets**") for a final consideration of C\$22,500,000 (equivalent to HK\$135,461,000). Upon closing of the transactions, the financial results of the Canadian Oil Assets have been incorporated in the Group's consolidated financial statements. For the period from 16 July 2022 to 31 December 2022, the Canadian Oil Assets contributed a revenue of HK\$30,932,000 and an operating profit of HK\$4,078,000 to the Group's results for FY2022, and for the same period, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation generated by the Canadian Oil Assets was HK\$13,178,000. The acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets represents a valuable and attractive opportunity for the Group to continue developing its petroleum exploration and production business.

In alignment with the Group's strategic initiatives to develop a diversified and balanced energy business portfolio, in July 2021, the Group entered into a cooperation framework agreement (the "**Cooperation Agreement**") with a specialist solar energy total solution and services provider to invest in solar energy power generation projects that are participating in the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff Scheme (the "**FiT Scheme**"), which is a scheme promoted by the Hong Kong Government to incentivise the private sector to produce clean energy for sale to the two power companies in Hong Kong. In August 2021, for further development of the solar energy business, the Group entered into an acquisition agreement (the "**Acquisition Agreement**") to acquire a portfolio of existing and to-be-completed solar energy power generation projects which are participating in the FiT Scheme. As of 31 December 2022, the Group has invested a sum of HK\$51,516,000 in solar energy power generation projects under the two aforementioned agreements.

For FY2022, the Group's petroleum exploration and production business contributed a profit of HK\$4,078,000 (2021: loss of HK\$4,112,000), the solar energy business contributed a profit of HK\$1,403,000 (2021: HK\$89,000), the money lending business recorded a loss of HK\$16,237,000 (2021: profit of HK\$17,440,000), and the Group's investment in securities recorded a loss of HK\$9,743,000 (2021: HK\$32,533,000).

{6}------------------------------------------------

# **Statement from the Board**

Overall speaking, the Group recorded an increase in revenue by 84% to HK\$45,102,000 (2021: HK\$24,496,000), mainly due to the incorporation of the Canadian Oil Assets' revenue in the Group's consolidated financial statements since July 2022, and reported a loss attributable to owners of the Company of HK\$46,746,000 (2021: HK\$29,371,000) that mainly due to (i) the recognition of net loss on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss of HK\$1,952,000 in contrast to the net gain of HK\$7,870,000 recorded in last year; (ii) the increase in depreciation which mainly related to the Canadian Oil Assets and the Group's solar energy power generation projects to HK\$13,130,000 (2021: HK\$1,666,000); (iii) the provision of expected credit loss ("**ECL**") on loan and interest receivables of HK\$20,019,000 (2021: reversal of ECL of HK\$4,356,000); and (iv) the increase in other expense to HK\$14,875,000 (2021: HK\$7,193,000) mainly due to the professional fees incurred for the acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets; whilst partly offset by (i) the decrease in provision of ECL on debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income to HK\$11,081,000 (2021: HK\$49,247,000), and (ii) the profit contributions from the petroleum exploration and production and solar energy businesses totalling HK\$5,481,000 (2021: net loss of HK\$4,023,000). Basic loss per share was HK0.89 cent (2021: HK0.56 cent).

### **PROSPECTS**

It is the Group's business strategy to continue developing its petroleum exploration and production business, along with expanding and diversifying its business in the energy sector to the next level by investing in renewable energy assets, including solar energy projects, which would support the healthy and sustainable business development of the Group in the long run and create new value to shareholders. In pursuance of these strategic initiatives, the Group has successfully acquired the Canadian Oil Assets, and entered into the Cooperation Agreement and Acquisition Agreement for the development of its solar energy business.

The Canadian Oil Assets are located near Calgary City, Alberta Province in Canada. The Group considers Canada is one of the ideal countries for developing petroleum exploration and production business as it has a stable political environment, a well-established system of oil regulations and industrial policies, a welldeveloped business infrastructure for the oil industry, and the third largest oil reserves in the world. There are thus enormous business opportunities available in Canada for the Group to develop its petroleum business.

The solar energy power generation projects the Group investing in are projects participating in the FiT Scheme. The FiT Scheme is a policy initiative introduced by the Hong Kong Government to encourage the private sector to participate in producing cleaner fuel and developing renewable energy technologies. Under the FiT Scheme, scheme participants who install solar or wind power generation system at their premises can sell the renewable energy generated to the two power companies in Hong Kong at a rate considerably higher than the normal electricity tariff rate. The FiT Scheme will be offered until the end of 2033, through investing in solar energy power generation projects participating in the FiT Scheme, the Group is able to secure a longterm and stable stream of revenue from the tariff income earning by the projects participating in the FiT Scheme.

Looking forward, the Group will continue to actively pursue its interests in the petroleum and solar energy businesses and will manage its businesses in a prudent approach in view of the business uncertainties brought by the heightened political and economic tensions between China and the US, and the war between Russia and Ukraine which brings significant volatilities to international prices of oil and gas.

It is the Group's business strategy to build a diversified and balanced energy business portfolio, comprising petroleum as well as solar energy assets, which will present the Group with favourable long-term prospects, and is in line with the Group's sustainable corporate strategy of broadening its income stream for the goal of achieving a stable, long-term and attractive return to shareholders.

### **BUSINESS REVIEW**

For the year ended 31 December 2022 ("**FY2022**"), the Group continued to principally engage in the business of petroleum exploration and production, solar energy, money lending and investment in securities.

During FY2022, there was a sharp surge in international oil prices largely because of the revival of economic activities worldwide following the easing of the COVID pandemic, and the tightened supply of energy sources following the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine. The price of Brent crude oil, one of the benchmarks of international oil prices, jumped from around US\$80 per barrel ("**bbl**") in December 2021 to its peak of over US\$130 per bbl in March 2022, and dropped back to around US\$80 per bbl in December 2022. Although international oil prices continue to fluctuate considerably recently, they are hovering at comparatively high levels to their historical trends in the past five years and current market outlook of the industry remains positive.

Leveraging on the Group's business experience of its oil operation in Argentina and with the intent of continuing its petroleum exploration and production business, as announced by the Company on 17 July 2022, the Group has completed the acquisition of an operating oilfield which comprises petroleum and natural gas rights, facilities and pipelines, together with all other properties and assets located in Alberta Province in Canada (the "**Canadian Oil Assets**") for a final consideration of C\$22,500,000 (equivalent to HK\$135,461,000). Upon closing of the transaction, the financial results of the Canadian Oil Assets have been incorporated in the Group's consolidated financial statements. For the period from 16 July 2022 to 31 December 2022, the Canadian Oil Assets contributed a revenue of HK\$30,932,000 and an operating profit of HK\$4,078,000 to the Group's results for FY2022, and for the same period, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciations and amortisation ("**EBITDA**") generated by the Canadian Oil Assets was HK\$13,178,000.

In alignment with the Group's strategic initiatives to develop a diversified and balanced energy business portfolio, in July 2021, the Group entered into a cooperation framework agreement (the "**Cooperation Agreement**") with a specialist solar energy total solution and services provider to invest in solar energy power generation projects that are participating in the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff Scheme (the "**FiT Scheme**"), which is a scheme promoted by the Hong Kong Government to incentivise the private sector to produce clean energy for sale to the two power companies in Hong Kong.

### **Petroleum Exploration and Production**

As stated in the Company's announcement dated 16 March 2021, the Group's interest in an oil concession in the Chañares Herrados area (the "**CHE Concession**") located in Cuyana Basin, Mendoza Province of Argentina was taken over by a new concessionaire on 13 March 2021, accordingly, the Group's petroleum exploration and production business in Argentina ceased in FY2022. As above mentioned, the acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets was completed on 16 July 2022, since then, the financial results of the Canadian Oil Assets have been incorporated in the Group's consolidated financial statements. For FY2022, the Group's petroleum exploration and production business (now constituted by the Canadian Oil Assets) generated a revenue of HK\$30,932,000, an operating profit of HK\$4,078,000 and an EBITDA of HK\$13,178,000 whilst in last year, before the CHE Concession was taken over, it generated a revenue of HK\$1,523,000 and incurred an operating losses of HK\$4,112,000. It is expected that the revenue and EBITDA generated by the Canadian Oil Assets will continue to grow in 2023 as their full year results, together with the production of new wells drilled, will be incorporated in the Group's results.

The Canadian Oil Assets represent an operating oilfield comprising petroleum and natural gas rights, facilities and pipelines, together with other properties and assets spanned on 8,818 net acres of land in Windy Lake region, near Calgary in Alberta Province of Canada.

The Canadian Oil Assets is managed under EP Resources Corporation ("**EPR**"), a Canadian incorporated whollyowned subsidiary of the Company, by a team of local management with extensive experience in the oil and gas industry in Calgary, Canada. For the period from 16 July 2022 to 31 December 2022, the Canadian Oil Assets produced approximately 81,300 bbl and sold 81,100 bbl of crude oil, and generated a revenue of approximately C\$6,618,000 (equivalent to HK\$39,821,000) (before royalties payment) at an average selling price of C\$81.6 per bbl. The crude oil produced from the Canadian Oil Assets were trucked and sold to the independent oil distributors located in the nearby regions who will largely resell the same to the American importers.

{10}------------------------------------------------

From July 2022 onwards and up to the end of 2022, EPR had incurred capital expenditure totalling C\$2,655,000 (equivalent to HK\$15,285,000) for new wells drilling and production enhancement work for the number of wells as shown in the table below:

|                         | Number of wells | Capital Expenditure |                        |  |
|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|--|
|                         |                 | C\$'000             | HK\$'000<br>equivalent |  |

| Additional perforations | 2               | 270                 | 1,555                  |  |
| Wells recompletion      | 1               | 89                  | 512                    |  |
|                         |                 | 2,655               | 15,285                 |  |

As of 31 December 2022, there were 35 producing wells in operation, with an average remaining reserve life of more than ten years, compared to 32 producing wells when the acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets took place in July 2022. The addition of the three producing wells was a result of the wells reactivations work performed. The drilling work of the three new wells were in progress at the end of 2022, with two were subsequently completed in January 2023 and one in February 2023. All three new wells drilled have commenced production and are currently in operation.

As at 31 December 2022, an update of the estimated oil reserves of the Canadian Oil Assets are as follows:

("**Trimble**") on the estimated oil reserves of the Canadian Oil Assets as at 31 December 2022, Trimble was the competent person engaged by the Company in preparing the competent person's report ("**CPR**") contained in the circular dated 11 March 2022 (the "**Circular**") in relation to the acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets. The same set of methodology adopted in preparing the CPR are adopted in preparing the Reserve Report. Further details of the Canadian Oil Assets were contained in the Circular.
# The Group acquired the Canadian Oil Assets in July 2022. The data of the estimated oil reserves of the Canadian Oil Assets as at 31 December 2021 are extracted from the Circular and are for illustration only.

According to the Group's initial four-year development plan for the Canadian Oil Assets, it was envisaged that 6, 14, 18 and 11 new wells would be drilled in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025. In respect of the 2022 drilling plan, for the reason that the completion time of acquiring the Canadian Oil Assets in July 2022 was later than envisaged when the development plan was first made, the Group could only manage to complete the drilling work for two new wells in January 2023 and one in February 2023. As for the planned drilling of the other three new wells, the plan is currently held up pending for further evaluation as based on the production data that the Group has collected from the local government authorities for the oilfields located near the target new wells, and the updated geological information including seismic data of the target new wells and the oilfields nearby, the production of the target new wells may not meet the desired level as originally anticipated. In respect of the 2023 drilling plan, the work is progressing as planned except that the number of new wells to be drilled on a target site will be 8 instead of 14 while the forecasted production from the new wells will remain the same. After further study of the geological information of the target site, the Group decided to employ a different horizontal drilling technique which could be more cost effective than the one originally planned, with the result that less wells will be drilled while the forecasted production level will remain the same. In respect of the drilling plans for 29 new wells in 2024 and 2025, based on the production data of nearby oilfields and geological information recently collected, together with other technical reasons, the plans will be revised with 14, 10 and 5 new wells to be drilled in 2024, 2025 and 2026, adding up to the same number of new wells as originally planned. Primarily owing to the change of drilling plan for 2022 and the completion time of the three new wells were deferred to before the end of February 2023, it caused a variance to the cashflow expected to be generated from the Canadian Oil Assets in 2022.

### **Solar Energy**

In recent years, major countries in the world are actively formulating their energy policies to curb carbon emissions and it is the Group's business strategy to expand its footprints in the energy sector through investing in renewable energy assets, including solar energy projects, which could support the Group's healthy and sustainable business development. On 23 July 2021, in order to capture the business opportunities in decarbonisation, the Group entered into the Cooperation Agreement with a specialist solar energy total solution and services provider to invest in solar energy power generation projects, from which the electricity generated can be sold to the two power companies and thereby earning the feed-in tariff income under the FiT Scheme. Moreover, for further development of the solar energy business, on 30 August 2021, the Group entered into the Acquisition Agreement to acquire a portfolio of existing and to-becompleted solar energy power generation projects which are participating in the FiT Scheme. Further details of the transactions were stated in the Company's announcements dated 23 July 2021, 30 August 2021 and 16 September 2021.

{12}------------------------------------------------

During FY2022, the Group has made further investment of HK\$7,871,000 and bringing the Group's total investment in solar energy power generation projects up to HK\$51,516,000 as of 31 December 2022, with a further capital commitment of approximately HK\$6,978,000. As of the year end, the Group has 40 solar photovoltaic systems in operation, and 10 solar photovoltaic systems are scheduled to be completed before the end of first quarter 2023. For FY2022, the solar energy business contributed a revenue and an operating profit of HK\$6,536,000 (2021: HK\$652,000) and HK\$1,403,000 (2021: HK\$89,000) respectively to the Group, and EBITDA of the business was HK\$5,157,000 (2021: HK\$396,000).

### **Money Lending**

For FY2022, the Group's money lending business reported decreases in revenue by 71% to HK\$3,877,000 (2021: HK\$13,182,000) and operating profit (before provision of ECL) by 71% to HK\$3,782,000 (2021: HK\$13,084,000), which were mainly due to the lower average amount of performing loans advanced to borrowers during FY2022. A provision of ECL of HK\$20,019,000 (2021: reversal of ECL of HK\$4,356,000) on loan and interest receivables was recognised during the year.

The Group performs impairment assessment on loan receivables under the ECL model. The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default, the loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss after accounting for value of the collateral if there is a default). The assessment of probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data and forward-looking information, whilst the valuation of the assets/properties pledged to the Group as collaterals are performed by independent professional valuers engaged by the Group, where applicable, at each reporting date for the purpose of determining ECL. In accordance with the Group's loan impairment policy, the amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect the changes in credit risk on loan receivables since initial recognition. At the period end, the net impairment allowance recognised primarily represented the credit risk involved in collectability of certain default and non-default loans determined under the Group's loan impairment policy, with reference to factors including the credit history and financial conditions of the borrowers, the ageing of the overdue balances, the realisation value of the collaterals pledged to the Group, and forward-looking information including the future macroeconomic conditions affecting the borrowers (the negative impact of the COVID epidemic on the economy had also been considered).

The Group has a system in place to closely monitor the recoverability of its loan portfolio, its credit monitoring measures include regular collateral value review against market information and regular communication with the borrowers of their financial positions, through which the Group will be able to keep updated with the latest credit profile and risk associated with each individual borrower and could take appropriate actions for recovery of a loan at the earliest time. If circumstances require, the Group will commence legal actions against the borrowers for recovery of the overdue loans and taking possession of the collaterals pledged.

For FY2022, a provision of ECL of HK\$20,019,000 (2021: reversal of ECL of HK\$4,356,000) was recognised which primarily represented the credit risk involved in collectability of certain credit-impaired loans determined under the Group's loan impairment policy, and have considered factors including the credit history of the borrowers, the realisation value of the collaterals pledged to the Group, and the prevailing economic conditions. The Group has taken various actions for recovery of the credit-impaired loans. There was no change in the method used in determining the impairment allowance on loan receivables from the prior financial year.

{13}------------------------------------------------

The size of the Group's loan portfolio reduced by 47% to HK\$60,582,000 (2021: HK\$115,001,000) (on a net of impairment allowance basis) was mainly a result of the settlement or partial repayment of certain loans. The Group aims to make loans that could be covered by sufficient collaterals, preferably properties and assets with good quality, and to borrowers with good credit history. The target customer groups of the business are individuals and corporate entities that have short-term funding needs for business purpose and could provide sufficient collaterals for their borrowings. The Group has a stable source of loan deals from its own business network and its sales agents.

At 31 December 2022, the carrying amount of the loan portfolio held by the Group amounted to HK\$60,852,000 (after impairment allowance of HK\$23,800,000) (2021: HK\$115,001,000 (after impairment allowance of HK\$34,915,000)) with details as follows:

|                       | Approximate<br>weighting to the<br>carrying amount<br>of the Group's | Interest rate | Maturity        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Category of borrowers | loan portfolio                                                       | per annum     |                 |
|                       | %                                                                    | %             |                 |

| Individual            | 23.1                                                                 | 11.0 – 18.0   | Within one year |

At 31 December 2022, 85% (2021: 100%) of the carrying amount of the loan portfolio (after impairment allowance) was secured by collaterals with 15% (2021: nil) being unsecured. At the year end, the loans made to all borrowers were term loans with maturity within one year, and the loan made to the largest borrower and the four largest borrowers accounted for 39% and 100% respectively of the Group's loan portfolio (on a net of impairment allowance basis).

The Group has credit policies, guidelines and procedures in place which cover key internal controls of a loan transaction including (i) due diligence; (ii) credit appraisal; (iii) proper execution of documentations; (iv) continuous monitoring and (v) collection and recovery. Before granting loan to a potential customer, the Group performs credit appraisal process to assess the potential borrower's credit quality and defines the credit limit granted to the borrower. The credit appraisal process encompasses detailed assessment on the credit history and financial background of the borrower, as well as the value and nature of the collateral to be pledged. The credit limit of a loan successfully granted to the borrower will be subject to regular credit review by the management as part of the ongoing loan monitoring process.

{14}------------------------------------------------

The following is a summary of the key internal controls of the Group's money lending operation:

| Due diligence    | Identity check and financial background check on the loan applicant         |  |  |  |  |

- Proper execution of documentations For loan application recommended by the responsible loan manager and duly approved by the board of directors of the Group's money lending subsidiary, the responsible loan officer will arrange preparation and proper execution of the loan documentations under the supervision of the responsible loan manager, and usually with the support of professional lawyers.
- Continuous monitoring There will be continuous monitoring on the repayments from borrower, regular communication with the borrower of its updated financial position, and regular review on credit limit of the loan granted and market value of the collateral pledged performed by the responsible loan officer and manager.

Collection and recovery Formal reminder and legal demand letter will be issued to the borrower if there is an overdue payment. Where appropriate, legal action will be commenced against the borrower for recovery of the amount due and taking possession of the collateral pledged.

All loans will be granted under the approval of the board of directors of the Group's money lending subsidiary.

{15}------------------------------------------------

### **Investment in Securities**

The Group generally acquires securities listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or other recognised stock exchanges and over-the-counter markets with good liquidity that can facilitate swift execution of securities transactions. For making investment or divestment decision on securities of individual target company, references will usually be made to the latest financial information, news and announcements issued by the target company, investment analysis reports that the Company has access to, as well as industry or macroeconomic news. When deciding on acquiring securities to be held for long-term purpose, particular emphasis will be placed on the past financial performance of the target company including its sales and profit growth, financial healthiness, dividend policy, business prospects, and industry and macroeconomic outlook. When deciding on acquiring securities to be held other than for long-term purpose, in addition to the factors mentioned, references will also be made to prevailing market sentiments on different sectors of the investment markets. In terms of return, for long-term securities investments, the Company mainly emphasises on return of investment in form of capital appreciation and dividend/interest income. For securities investment other than for long-term holding, the Company mainly emphasises on return of investment in form of trading gains.

At 31 December 2022, the Group's securities investments comprised a financial asset at FVTPL portfolio valued at HK\$4,772,000 (2021: HK\$6,724,000), comprising equity securities listed in Hong Kong, and a debt instrument at FVTOCI portfolio (constituted by non-current and current portions) valued at HK\$33,739,000 (2021: HK\$78,396,000), comprising debt securities listed in Hong Kong or Singapore. As a whole, the Group's securities investments recorded a revenue of HK\$3,757,000 (2021: HK\$9,139,000) and a loss, after provision of ECL, of HK\$9,743,000 (2021: HK\$32,533,000).

### *Financial assets at FVTPL*

At 31 December 2022, the Group held a financial asset at FVTPL portfolio amounting to HK\$4,772,000 (2021: HK\$6,724,000) measured at market/fair value. For FY2022, the portfolio generated a revenue of HK\$152,000 (2021: HK\$268,000), representing dividends from equity securities. The Group recognised a net loss on financial assets at FVTPL of HK\$1,952,000 (2021: gain of HK\$7,870,000) for FY2022, which comprised net unrealised loss of HK\$1,952,000 (2021: net realised gain and net unrealised loss of HK\$9,099,000 and HK\$1,229,000 respectively).

The net unrealised loss represented the decrease in market value of those equity securities held by the Group at the year end. The Group continued to adopt a prudent and disciplined approach in managing its financial asset at FVTPL portfolio and had not acquired any equity securities during the current year.

#### *Debt instruments at FVTOCI*

At 31 December 2022, the Group's debt instrument at FVTOCI portfolio (constituted by non-current and current portions) of HK\$33,739,000 (2021: HK\$78,396,000) was measured at market/fair value. During FY2022, the Group's debt instrument at FVTOCI portfolio generated a revenue amounting to HK\$3,605,000 (2021: HK\$8,871,000), representing interest income from debt securities. According to the maturity profile of the debt instruments, part of the debt instruments at FVTOCI of HK\$28,041,000 (2021: HK\$47,712,000) was classified as current assets.

During FY2022, the Group had not acquired any debt securities (2021: nil), and principal of certain debt securities totalling HK\$32,370,000 were redeemed. At the year end, a net fair value loss on debt instruments at FVTOCI of HK\$11,238,000 (2021: HK\$54,714,000) was recognised as other comprehensive expense primarily due to the fall in market value of these debt securities and downward adjustment on fair value of certain debt instruments due to their increased credit risks.

{17}------------------------------------------------

The Group had engaged an independent professional valuer to perform an impairment assessment on the debt instruments held under the ECL model. The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default and loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default), with the assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data and forward-looking information. The estimation of ECL reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined with the respective risks of default occurring as the weights, and also with reference to the time value of money. In determining the ECL on the Group's debt instruments for the year, the management had worked closely with the independent professional valuer and taken into accounts factors including the withdrawal or downgrading of credit ratings of the debt instruments by the credit rating agencies, the defaults of the bond issuers in making payments of interest and principal for their indebtedness, as well as forward-looking information including the future macroeconomic conditions at places where the bond issuers are operating. There was no change in the method used in determining the ECL on debt instruments at FVTOCI from last year. Further details of the credit risk and impairment assessment on the debt instruments at FVTOCI are contained in Note 37 to the consolidated financial statements.

For FY2022, a provision of ECL on debt instruments at FVTOCI of HK\$11,081,000 (2021: HK\$49,247,000) was recognised in profit or loss (with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income) as the credit risks of certain debt instruments held by the Group had further increased since initial recognition. During FY2022, the credit ratings of these debt instruments, which were corporate bonds issued by property companies based in the Mainland, were withdrawn or downgraded by the credit rating agencies as the credit risks of these bonds had increased significantly due to the bond issuers' defaults in making interest and principal payments for their indebtedness. As the Group expected the financial uncertainties of these bond issuers would ultimately affect the collection of contractual cash flows of these bonds, a provision of ECL on debt instruments at FVTOCI of HK\$11,081,000 was recognised.

### **FINANCIAL REVIEW**

### **Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capital Structure**

During FY2022, the Group financed its operation mainly by cash generated from its operations and shareholders' funds. At the year end, the Group had current assets of HK\$191,386,000 (2021: HK\$363,774,000) and liquid assets comprising cash and cash equivalents as well as financial assets at FVTPL totalling HK\$90,568,000 (2021: HK\$198,548,000). The Group's current ratio, calculated based on current assets over current liabilities of HK\$21,797,000 (2021: HK\$14,105,000), was at a liquid level of about 8.8 (2021: 25.8). The decrease in liquid assets was mainly due to the payment of consideration of HK\$135,461,000 for the acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets.

At 31 December 2022, the Group's total assets amounted to HK\$433,689,000 (2021: HK\$442,915,000), the Group's gearing ratio, calculated on the basis of total liabilities of HK\$57,376,000 (2021: HK\$16,925,000) divided by total assets, was at a low level of about 13% (2021: 4%). Finance costs represented the accretion expense on decommissioning obligation and imputed interest on lease liabilities of HK\$1,127,000 (2021: nil) and HK\$119,000 (2021: HK\$101,000) respectively recognised for the year.

At 31 December 2022, the equity attributable to owners of the Company amounted to HK\$376,313,000 (2021: HK\$425,990,000) and was equivalent to an amount of approximately HK7.18 cents (2021: HK8.13 cents) per share of the Company. The decrease in equity attributable to owners of the Company of HK\$49,677,000 was mainly due to the loss incurred by the Group for the year.

With the amount of liquid assets on hand, the management is of the view that the Group has sufficient financial resources to meet its ongoing operational requirements.

{19}------------------------------------------------

### **Foreign Currency Management**

The monetary assets and liabilities as well as business transactions of the Group are mainly denominated in Canadian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and United States dollars. The Group has not experienced any significant foreign exchange exposure to United States dollars as the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars to United States dollars is pegged. The Group's foreign exchange exposure to Canadian dollars could be significant depending on the volatilities of exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars to Canadian dollars, the Group does not currently have a formal foreign currency hedging policy for Canadian dollars and will adopt one in due course should significant exposure arise.

### **Contingent Liability**

At 31 December 2022, the Group had no significant contingent liability (31 December 2021: nil).

### **Pledge of Assets**

At 31 December 2022, the Group had not pledged any assets (31 December 2021: nil).

### **Capital Commitment**

At 31 December 2022, the Group had a total capital commitment of HK\$6,978,000 for acquisition of solar photovoltaic systems which was capital expenditure contracted for but not provided (31 December 2021: HK\$34,390,000).

### **HUMAN RESOURCES AND REMUNERATION POLICY**

At 31 December 2022, the Group had a total of 23 (2021: 21) employees including directors of the Company with 15 (2021: 18) employees stationed in Hong Kong and the PRC, 8 (2021: nil) employees in Canada and nil (2021: 3) employees in Argentina. Staff costs, including directors' emoluments, amounted to HK\$7,300,000 (2021: HK\$9,799,000) for the year. The drop in staff costs of HK\$2,499,000 was mainly due to the decrease of the Group's headcounts for its operation in the PRC and Argentina. The remuneration packages for directors and staff are normally reviewed annually and are structured by reference to prevailing market terms and individual competence, performance and experience. The Group operates a Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme (the "**MPF Scheme**") for its employees in Hong Kong and a pension scheme for its employees in Canada. In addition, the Group provides other employee benefits which include medical insurance, discretionary bonus and participation in the Company's share option scheme.

The Group's contributions to the MPF Scheme and the other employees' pension scheme are calculated as a percentage of the employees' relevant income and vest fully and immediately with the employees, thus there are no forfeited contributions available to the Group to reduce the existing level of contributions to the MPF Scheme and the other employees' pension scheme.

### **PRINCIPAL RISK AND UNCERTAINTIES**

The Group is principally engaged in the business of petroleum exploration and production, solar energy, money lending and investment in securities.

### **Business Risk**

The global economic conditions and the state of international financial and investment markets, including the economy, financial and investment markets of the US, Mainland China and Hong Kong, of which the Group has no control, have significant influences on the business and financial performance of the Group.

### **Market Risk**

#### **Environmental Risk**

The Group's petroleum and solar energy businesses are constantly exposed to inherent risks such as mechanical breakdown of equipment, adverse weather conditions, flood, fire or other calamities. Any of these factors may cause disruptions to the Group's operations. The Group may also be liable to pay compensations resulting from the above events which may adversely affect its financial performance.

#### **Financial Risk**

The Group is exposed to financial risks relating to interest rate, foreign currency, securities price, credit and liquidity risk in its ordinary course of business. Further details of such risks and relevant management policies are set out in Note 37 to the consolidated financial statements.

### **COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS**

As far as the Board and the management are aware, the Group has complied in material respects with the relevant laws and regulations that have a significant impact on the businesses and operations of the Group. During FY2022, there was no material breach of or non-compliance with the applicable laws and regulations by the Group.

### **CULTURES AND VALUES**

The Board believes a healthy corporate culture is vital in attaining the Group's vision, values and strategy. It trusts that conducting business in an ethical and reliable way will maximise its long-term interests and those of its stakeholders. The structure of corporate governance adopted by the Company emphasises a quality board, sound internal controls and accountability to shareholders and these are based upon an ethical corporate culture. It is the Board's mission to establish and foster a healthy corporate culture with the following principles and to ensure that the Company's vision, values and business strategies are aligned to it.

### **(i) Ethics and Integrity**

The Group strives to maintain a high standard of business ethics and corporate governance across all business levels and operating activities. Directors, management and staff are all required to act lawfully, ethically and responsibly. Such required standards are set out in the Group's Code of Conduct, Anticorruption Policy and Whistleblowing Policy (further discussions on the two policies are in the sections below). Trainings are conducted from time to time to reinforce the values across the Group and to uphold the standards with respect to ethics and integrity.

### **(ii) Commitment to Excellence**

The Group believes commitment to excellence is the first step to continuous improvement and the driving force behind a business organisation. The Group implements a performance appraisal system and aims to reward and recognise performing staff by providing them competitive remuneration packages, as well as the opportunities of career development and progression within the Group. Such values are articulated in policies, procedures and processes in day-to-day operations.

In addition, staff are also encouraged to enroll in external training courses, seminars in order to update their technical skills and keep abreast of the market and regulatory developments.

### **RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL**

The Board acknowledges its responsibility for maintaining sound and effective risk management and internal control systems and reviewing their effectiveness to safeguard the shareholders' interests and the Group's assets at least annually. The systems are designed to identifying, analysing, evaluating and mitigating risk exposures that may impact the continued efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of the Group. The goal of the risk management and internal control mechanism is to provide reasonable assurance regarding the fulfilment of corporate development strategies and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

Effective risk management is essential in the long-term growth and sustainability of the Group's businesses. The Board monitors the risk management and internal control systems on an ongoing basis, evaluates and determines the nature and extent of the risks it is willing to take in achieving the strategic objectives. An annual review of effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems has been conducted. The annual review covers financial, operational and compliance controls of key operations of the Group and ensures the adequacy of resources, staff qualifications and experience, training programmes and budget of the Group's accounting, internal audit and financial reporting functions.

{42}------------------------------------------------

### **RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL (continued)**

The process used to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks (including environmental, social and governance ("**ESG**") risks) of the Group is embedded in the Group's normal business operations. Organisational structure is well established with clearly defined authorities and responsibilities, and the Group has developed various risk management and internal control policies and procedures for each business unit to follow. Business units are responsible for identifying, assessing and monitoring risks (including ESG risks) associated with their respective units regularly. The results of the assessment are reported to the management which subsequently assesses the likelihood of risk occurrence, provides remedial plan and monitors the progress of rectification with the assistance of the head of the business units. The results of the assessment and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems have been reported to the Audit Committee.

In connection with the controls on compliance aspect, guidelines are provided to the directors, officers, management and relevant staff in handling and disseminating sensitive and confidential inside information with due care. Only personnel at appropriate level can get reach of the sensitive and confidential inside information.

The Group does not have an internal audit function due to the size of the Group and consideration for cost effectiveness. Instead, the Company had engaged an external consultant to conduct a review on the Group's risk management and internal control systems to identify and evaluate significant risks (including ESG risks) of the business operations for the year ended 31 December 2022. The Board believes that the involvement of the external consultant could enhance the objectivity and transparency of the evaluation process. The external consultant has conducted an annual review to identify risks (including ESG risks) that could potentially impact the businesses of the Group, review key operational and financial processes as well as regulatory compliance and information security, and assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The review covered all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls. After the review, a Risk Management and Internal Control Report (the "**RM and IC Report**") with findings and recommendations for improvement in relation to the systems has been provided to the Audit Committee and the management. The RM and IC Report has been endorsed by the Audit Committee and the management is required to establish remedial plans and take actions to rectify those internal control deficiencies identified (which are all at low risk level) according to its respective risk level and priorities. Subsequent review will be performed by the external consultant to monitor the implementation of those agreed recommendations and to report the results of the follow-up review to the Audit Committee.

After reviewing the RM and IC Report, the Board is not aware of any significant risk management and internal control weaknesses or inconsistencies with the Group's risk management and internal control policies, and considers the existing risk management and internal control systems are effective and adequate. The Board is also of the opinion that the Group has adequate financial and human resources for its accounting and financial reporting function as well as those relating to the Group's ESG performance. The Company has complied with the relevant code provisions of the CG Code relating to risk management and internal control.

### **Anti-corruption Policy**

The Board had adopted an anti-fraud and counter-corruption policy (the "**Anti-corruption Policy**") which forms an important part of the Group's effective risk management and internal control systems. The Group is committed to achieving high standards of business ethics and corporate governance across all business levels and operating activities and has zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption. It strives to protect its reputation, assets and information from any attempt of fraud, corruption, deceit or improper conduct by employees or third parties. In line with this, the Anti-corruption Policy has outlined the Company's expectations and requirements relating to the prevention, detection, reporting and investigation of any suspected fraud, corruption and other similar irregularities. The Anti-corruption Policy applies to all Group employees and all business partners, including customers, suppliers and debtors. The Audit Committee has the overall responsibility for the implementation, monitoring and periodic review of the Anti-corruption Policy.

### **Whistleblowing Policy**

The Board has adopted a whistleblowing policy (the "**Whistleblowing Policy**") which forms an important part of the Group's effective risk management and internal control systems. In line with the Group's commitment to promote ethical standards and to uncover any fraud, malpractice and misconduct within the organisation, the purpose of the Whistleblowing Policy is to (i) encourage and assist any employee(s) of the Group or third parties (e.g. customers, suppliers etc.) to raise the concern and disclose related information confidentially; (ii) provide reporting channels and guidance on whistleblowing to employees or third parties to raise the concern rather than neglecting it; and (iii) reveal suspected fraud, malpractice or misconduct before these activities cause disruption or loss to the Group. The Audit Committee has the overall responsibility for implementing, monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Whistleblowing Policy and the actions resulting from the investigation.

### **INTRODUCTION**

The Board is pleased to present this Environmental, Social and Governance ("**ESG**") Report ("**ESG Report**") of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022 (the "**Reporting Period**" or "**2022**"). The Group is principally engaged in the business of petroleum exploration and production, solar energy, money lending and investment in securities.

The ESG Report summarises the policies, sustainability strategies, management approach and initiatives implemented by the Group, as well as the performance of the Group in environmental and social aspects of its businesses.

### **REPORTING SCOPE**

The Group identifies the reporting scope by considering the materiality principle, its core business and its main revenue source. During the Reporting Period, the Group completed the acquisition of an operating oilfield which comprises petroleum and natural gas rights, facilities and pipelines, together with all other properties and assets located in Alberta Province in Canada (the "**Canadian Oil Assets**"). The scope of this ESG Report covers the Group's major business operations and activities in Hong Kong and the petroleum exploration and production business in Canada since the completion of the acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets in July 2022, but excludes the petroleum exploration and production business in Argentina which was ceased in March 2021. The Group will further expand its reporting scope in the future, where appropriate.

### **REPORTING BASIS**

The ESG Report has been prepared in accordance with the Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide set out in Appendix 27 to the Listing Rules. Information relating to the Group's corporate governance practices is set out in the "Corporate Governance Report" on pages 30 to 45 of this annual report.

### **REPORTING PRINCIPLES**

The Group adheres to the following reporting principles as the basis for preparation of the ESG Report:

**Materiality:** The content of this ESG Report is determined by stakeholder participation and materiality assessment process, which includes identifying material environmental and social related issues, collecting and reviewing the views and suggestions of the management and stakeholders, assessing the relevance and significance of different issues and compiling the reported content, further details of which are set out in the sections headed "Stakeholder Engagement" and "Materiality Assessment" below.

**Quantitative:** The key performance indicators ("**KPIs**") relating to the environmental and social aspects are disclosed in this ESG Report which provide stakeholders of the Group a comprehensive picture of the Group's ESG performance. Where appropriate, relevant data are supplemented by explanatory notes to establish benchmarks.

{48}------------------------------------------------

### **REPORTING PRINCIPLES (continued)**

**Balance:** Every effort has been made in this ESG Report to reflect the performance of the Group's ESG activities impartially and has avoided selection, omission or presentation of format that might inappropriately influence the decision or judgment of the readers of this ESG Report.

**Consistency:** Except for the change in reporting scope, the approach in preparing this ESG Report is consistent with the ESG Reports in the previous years to allow for meaningful comparison. If there are any additional changes that may affect the comparison with the previous reports, explanation will be provided for the corresponding data.

### **ESG MANAGEMENT**

#### **Report from the Board**

The Group is committed to corporate social responsibility and recognises the importance of environmental, social and economic benefits. The Group also hopes to balance its business development with the interests of its key stakeholders and operates its businesses in a sustainable manner. To achieve this vision, the Group has set a sustainability framework that focuses on environmental protection, resource management, employee and community well-being and guides its sustainability efforts to ensure that sustainability elements are integrated into all operation and all business decisions.

Global warming is a growing concern. As a socially responsible corporate, the Group is committed to mitigating its environmental impact and integrating responsible environmental practices into its businesses. The Group has been running its solar energy business with a view to contribute its efforts in promoting the use of clean and renewable energy and building a greener environment. The Board retains the collective responsibility for the management approach, strategies and reporting of the Group's ESG matters. In order to better evaluate, prioritise and manage the Group's ESG-related issues, the Board discusses and reviews the Group's ESG-related risks and opportunities, performance, goals and targets with the assistance of the management team at least annually.

During the Reporting Period, the employees of the Group had shown strong team spirit and the Group had provided multi-pronged support to the employees in the midst of the COVID pandemic to avoid infection, and helped to prevent the spread of virus in the community. The Group had provided various supportive measures which included providing epidemic prevention materials and rapid antigen test kits to employees, and facilitating "work from home" arrangement. Despite the severity of the pandemic, the Group remained concerned about employees' remuneration and benefits, career development opportunities, provision of safe working environment, and fulfilling corporate social responsibility. Going forward, upon the revival of economic activities worldwide following the easing of the pandemic, the Group hopes that all employees and the community will continue to put unremitting efforts in going through the adversities and challenges, and make continuous progress towards sustainable development.

{49}------------------------------------------------

### **ESG MANAGEMENT (continued)**

### **Report from the Board (continued)**

To achieve this vision, the Board has set a number of environmental and social KPIs and has taken a top-down approach to disintegrate the KPIs into the functional departments. The Board not only aimed to improve the well-being of the employees, but also encourages the employees to participate in making changes in different areas, which include reducing greenhouse gas ("**GHG**") emissions and making good use of resources. During the Reporting Period, the Board had actively supported the implementation of the Group's sustainable development strategies and action plans by the management team and all employees. The relevant scope, progress and achievements relating to the environmental and social KPIs are disclosed in this ESG Report. The Group hopes that its professional management team can continue to commit to stable operation and prudent financial management policy, meet the challenges ahead with success, implement sustainable development strategies, improve business performance and create more meaningful long-term value for the enterprise and its stakeholders.

#### **Governance Structure**

The Board believes that sound ESG strategies can create investment value for the Group and deliver longterm returns to its stakeholders. The establishment of an appropriate governance framework is critical to the successful implementation of the Group's ESG sustainability strategies and an ESG governance structure with clear duties and responsibilities has been set up by the Group. The Board has established the longterm policies and strategies for all sustainability matters and will review the implementation status and progress of the ESG matters annually and report on its performance. The Board has also reviewed the progress made against ESG-related goals and targets through internal meetings with the management team. The management team reports to the Board at least annually to assist the Board in assessing and determining whether the Company has established an appropriate and effective internal control system to contain the ESG risks. At the operational level, functional units are responsible for ensuring the integration of sustainability strategies and practices into the Group's business operations as well as exploring new action plans/initiatives.

Environmental Employee Operation

- 

{55}------------------------------------------------

### **A. ENVIRONMENTAL**

Owing to the Group's business nature, its daily operations may impact, both directly and indirectly, the environment. Therefore, the Group is committed to maintaining the long-term sustainability of the environment and community where the Group operates, and thus integrated environmental and social consideration into its decision making process and assumes the responsibilities of creating an environmentally sustainable business.

As the Group is engaged in the petroleum exploration and production business, it inevitably generates emissions and other pollutants during daily operations. Therefore, the Group recognises the importance of continuous improvement on ESG performance and its responsibilities towards the potential negative environmental impacts associated with its business operations, and thus has established relevant internal guidelines to ensure strict compliance with all local environmental-related laws and regulations, as well as focuses on nurturing and strengthening its employees' awareness of environmental protection in their daily work processes.

Owing to the nature of the Canadian Oil Assets operation, GHG emissions from consumption of different types of fuel and energy, together with hazardous and non-hazardous waste arising from operation will be inevitably produced, which will be discussed in the sections "A1. Emissions" and "A2. Use Of Resources" below. The daily operations of the oilfield, new wells drilling and other production enhancement activities consume different types of fuel and energy including (i) electricity and propane consumed mainly for well fluid extraction from wells, water separation from the well fluid, and water injection back into underground, and (ii) diesel and propane consumed mainly for running rigs for new wells drilling and other production enhancement works. The consumption of fuel and energy generated Scope 1 GHG emissions, and purchased electricity generated Scope 2 GHG emissions. In addition, hazardous wastes including waste oil and fluid, and non-hazardous wastes including drill cuttings, will be produced from the daily operations, new wells drilling and other production enhancement activities of the Canadian Oil Assets.

The Group commenced its solar energy business in 2021 through investing in solar energy power generation projects located in Hong Kong, under which solar photovoltaic ("**SPV**") systems built are connected to the power grid of CLP Power Hong Kong ("**CLP**") under the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff Scheme (the "**FiT Scheme**"), and electricity produced by the SPV systems is supplied and sold to CLP. The FiT Scheme is an initiative promoted by the two power companies and the Hong Kong Government aiming to incentivise the private sector to produce clean energy for consumption in Hong Kong, which also serves as an important mean of the government's plan of achieving carbon neutrality before 2025. The Group has successfully integrated the environmental protection aspect of its ESG-initiatives into a viable business model, and is committed to continue contributing its efforts in promoting the use of clean and renewable energy and building a greener environment for the community.

Owing to the change in reporting scope during the Reporting Period, the Group considered its ESG targets set in 2021 were no longer applicable, and thus has revised its ESG targets in 2022. The revised targets are described in the sections headed "Air and GHG Emissions", "Waste Management" and "Energy Conservation Measures" below.

{56}------------------------------------------------

### **A. ENVIRONMENTAL (continued)**

### **Operational Compliance**

The Group adopts industry practices and guidelines in its management of environmental risks arising from the petroleum exploration and production operation in Canada. The Group strictly complies with all the relevant environmental laws and regulations. During the Reporting Period, the Group was not aware of any material non-compliance with laws and regulations in Canada concerning air and GHG emissions, discharges into water and land, and generation of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that would have a significant impact on the Group, including but not limited to the Alberta Energy Regulator Directive 58: Oilfield Waste Management Requirements for the Upstream Petroleum Industry, Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999), Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) and Environmental Management Act (EMA) of Canada.

#### **A1. Emissions**

#### *Air and GHG Emissions*

The Group is committed to minimising air emissions from its operations and ensuring compliance with the statutory emission standards. As the Group's daily operations currently do not involve in the usage of company vehicles, the Group does not generate significant amount of air emissions owing to use of vehicles. Nonetheless, the Group has established policies relating to fuel-saving of company vehicles such as minimising their use, eliminating excessive fuel consumption, and carrying out regular vehicle inspection and maintenance.

The Group has always been committed to assessing and reporting its carbon footprint to the public. During the Reporting Period, the major sources of the Group's GHG emissions were direct GHG emissions from diesel and propane consumption arising from the daily operations, new well drilling and other production enhancement activities of the Canadian Oil Assets (Scope 1) and energy indirect GHG emissions from electricity purchased for the daily use of the Canadian Oil Assets (Scope 2). Owing to the change in reporting scope, the Group has set a revised target to gradually reduce the Group's GHG emissions intensity (tCO2 e/thousand bbl5 ) over the next five years, using 2022 as the baseline year. To achieve the set target, the Group will continue its efforts in mitigating the GHG emissions in the following years including exploring ways to lower the use of purchased electricity, phasing out energy-inefficient equipment when it reaches the end of the equipment lifecycle and enhancing the Group's employees' environmental awareness.

During 2022, the Group's total GHG emissions intensity increased significantly compared to 2021. This is mainly due to the expansion in the reporting scope to include the Group's petroleum exploration and production business in Canada, which is in sizeable scale.

|                           | tCO2e/thousand bbl5 | 21.09     | N/A   |

- 1. GHG emissions data are presented in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent and are based on, but not limited to, "The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards" issued by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, "How to prepare an ESG Report – Appendix 2: Reporting Guidance on Environmental KPIs" issued by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the latest released emission factors of China's regional power grid basis, the "Global Warming Potential Values" from the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2014 and the Sustainability Report 2022 published by HK Electric.
- 2. These figures represent GHG emissions from the diesel and propane consumption (Scope 1) and purchased electricity (Scope 2) of the Group's Canadian Oil Assets.
- 3. These figures are related to the petroleum exploration and production business in Argentina which was ceased in March 2021, its consumption of natural gas and electricity and the corresponding GHG emissions have been restated to conform with current year presentation.
- 4. As at 31 December 2022, the Group had a total of 23 (2021: 21) directors and employees. This data is used for calculating intensity data per employee and employees related data.
- 5. The Group's Canadian Oil Assets produced approximately 81,300 barrels ("**bbl**") of crude oil in 2022. As the petroleum exploration and production business in Canada accounts for most of the Group's GHG emissions/hazardous wastes/non-hazardous wastes/energy consumption, this production data of crude oil is used for calculating intensity data per thousand bbl, in addition to the intensity data per employee. Owing to the change in the reporting scope, this intensity data type will be disclosed from 2022 onwards.

{58}------------------------------------------------

### **A. ENVIRONMENTAL (continued)**

- **A1. Emissions (continued)**
### *Air and GHG Emissions (continued)*

During the Reporting Period, the Group did not generate any nitrogen oxide ("**NOx**") (2021: 11.74 kilograms), sulphur oxide ("**SOx**") (2021: 0.03 kilograms) and particulate matters ("**PM**") (2021: 1.08 kilograms) as its operations currently do not involve in the usage of company vehicles. The air emissions of NOx, SOx and PM generated in 2021 was due to the vehicles used by the Group's petroleum exploration and production business in Argentina.

#### **Sewage Discharge**

The Group's office in Hong Kong and Canada do not consume a significant volume of water during their daily operations, and thus do not generate a material portion of sewage. As waste water from the Group's offices will be discharged into sewage pipe networks connected to the regional water purification plants, the water consumed by the Group is considered as sewage discharged. Details of the Group's water injection and water consumption are set out in the section headed "Water Resources Utilisation" below.

#### **Waste Management**

#### *Hazardous wastes*

The Group's Canadian Oil Assets operation inevitably generates hazardous wastes including waste oil and fluid from its daily operations, new wells drilling and other production enhancement activities. Nonetheless, the Group strictly abides by all waste-related laws and regulations in Canada and strives to reduce the amount of hazardous wastes generated from its operations. The Group engages qualified subcontractors to collect, manage and dispose of all hazardous wastes generated from its operations, in compliance with local laws and regulations.

In order to minimise the environmental impacts from hazardous wastes generated from the Group's operations and achieve the set target, the Group has implemented measures to reduce waste production and regularly monitors the waste production level. If any abnormal fluctuations in the amount of hazardous waste produced are identified, the Group will conduct investigation to identify the source of such fluctuations. It is the Group's internal operational guidance to entrust all hazardous wastes to qualified third party for compliant disposal.

{59}------------------------------------------------

### **A. ENVIRONMENTAL (continued)**

**Waste Management (continued)**

*Hazardous wastes (continued)*

Summary of hazardous wastes disposal and its intensity performance is as follows:

| Indicator              | Unit               | 2022  | 2021 |
|------------------------|--------------------|-------|------|
|                        |                    |       |      |
| Total hazardous wastes | tonne              | 65.63 | –    |
| Intensity              | tonne/employee     | 2.85  | –    |
|                        | tonne/thousand bbl | 0.81  | N/A  |

#### *Generation of non-hazardous wastes*

The Group's Canadian Oil Assets operation inevitably generates non-hazardous waste including waste papers from its daily operations and drill cuttings from new wells drilling and other production enhancement activities. The Group strives to minimise the potential environmental risks and impacts caused by its wastes by developing effective waste treatment strategies and policies. Waste management mainly involves recycling waste papers and collection of domestic wastes. Clearly labelled recycling bins are provided for collection of waste papers, plastic bottles, etc. Wastes are properly sorted and are stored in designated collection areas. After identifying and classifying the wastes, the recyclable wastes collected are then delivered to the waste collectors for regular recycling. In respect of drill cuttings, it is the Group's internal operational guidance to entrust this non-hazardous waste produced in the oilfield to licensed third party for compliant disposal.

In order to minimise the environmental impacts from non-hazardous wastes generated from the Group's operation, the Group has implemented measures to reduce waste papers. The Group encourages its employees to read documents in electronic format, to consider the environment before printing, to despatch memos and announcements via emails, to preview document layout on computer screen, to print documents on both sides of the papers, to procure paper bearing the Forest Stewardship Council Recycled Label for financial reports printing, and to promote "green office" concepts in the workplace. The Group also encourages its employees to reduce the use of nonrecyclable materials to minimise the adverse impact on the environment. Owing to the change in reporting scope, the Group has set a revised target to conduct annual activities to raise awareness of waste reduction among employees from 2022 onwards.

During the Reporting Period, the Group's total non-hazardous wastes intensity (tonne/employee) increased significantly compared to 2021. This is mainly due to the expansion in the reporting scope to include the Group's petroleum exploration and production business in Canada, which is in sizeable scale.

| Indicator                  | Unit               | 2022   | 2021 |
|----------------------------|--------------------|--------|------|
| Total non-hazardous wastes | tonne              | 601.86 | 0.47 |
| Intensity                  | tonne/employee     | 26.17  | 0.02 |
|                            | tonne/thousand bbl | 7.40   | N/A  |

Summary of non-hazardous wastes disposal and its intensity performance is as follows:

### **A. ENVIRONMENTAL (continued)**

### **A2. Use of Resources**

### *Energy Conservation Measures*

The Group actively implements the concept of energy conservation, emission reduction and maintain conscious use of resources. The Group's energy consumption mainly comprises diesel and propane consumption and electricity purchased for its daily operations, new wells drilling and other production enhancement activities for its Canadian Oil Assets.

For the Group office-based operations in Hong Kong and Canada, the Group encourages its employees to change their habit of using electrical appliances, and has introduced control measures including turning off lightings, air-conditioners, computers, personal electronic devices and office equipment after work and/or when they are idle, or turning on the power saving mode. The Group also aims to keep all electronic appliances well-maintained so as to extend the life of the equipment. The Group encourages its employees to avoid wastage of resources, and promotes their awareness of environmental protection in work and life through various means including posting eye-catching stickers of energy efficiency in visible place in office. Owing to the change in reporting scope, the Group has set a revised target to conduct annual activities to raise awareness of energy conservation among employees from 2022 onwards and gradually reduce the Group's energy consumption intensity (MWh/ thousand bbl) over the next five years, using 2022 as the baseline year. To achieve the set target, the Group has established policies and procedures to achieve electricity conservation and efficient use of electricity among a range of lighting, electronic devices, electrical appliances and equipment.

During the Reporting Period, the Group's total energy consumption intensity increased significantly compared to 2021, which is mainly due to the expansion in the reporting scope to include the Group's petroleum exploration and production business in Canada, which is in sizeable scale.

Aiming to reduce GHG emissions and to contribute building a greener environment, the Group is assessing the feasibility to lower the use of purchased electricity for the Canadian Oil Assets operation through the use of natural gas, or other renewable energy generation methods including solar energy or wind energy, for electricity generation.

*Notes:*

- 6. The method of calculating energy consumption data is based on the "Energy Statistics Manual" issued by the International Energy Agency.
- 7. During 2021, the Group's petroleum exploration and production operation in Argentina consumed approximately 551 liters of gasoline, 1,127 liters of diesel and 2,129,782 liters of natural gas.
- 8. Owing to the enhancement of the Group's data processing mechanism, the equivalent amount of energy consumption in MWh will be disclosed from 2022 onwards.

#### *Natural Gas Consumption*

The Group's petroleum exploration and production business in Argentina used natural gas for heating and its operation ceased since March 2021. The Group had not consumed any natural gas since then including the Reporting Period.

#### *Water Resources Utilisation*

During the daily operations of the Canadian Oil Assets, a large volume of water will be extracted from underground together with the crude oil in form of well fluid, and then the water is needed to be separated from the well fluid and injected back into underground. During the Reporting Period, the Group had injected approximately 377,000 cubic meter of water back into underground, in compliance with local environmental rules and practices. The operation did not consume any fresh water, surface water, seawater or third-party water during the Reporting Period for the oil extraction process.

*Water Resources Utilisation (continued)*

For the Group's office-based operations in Hong Kong and Canada, the Group does not have any issues in sourcing water that is fit for its purpose as water is adequately supplied by the government authorities to the office buildings where the Group's offices are located. Nonetheless, the Group recognises the scarcity of resources the environment could offer and always encourages its staff members to cherish water usage.

The water consumption data for the Group's offices in Hong Kong and Canada are not available since water usage is covered in the office building management fees and the building management companies are not able to provide water consumption and discharge data for individual office unit. Since the volume of drinking water purchased for office use is also considered as insignificant, the target for water efficiency is therefore not presented as water consumption data are not available. The 2021 figures shown in the table below represent the water consumption of the Group's Argentina office, which ceased to operate during the Reporting Period.

| Indicator               | Unit           | 2022 | 2021  |
|-------------------------|----------------|------|-------|
|                         |                |      |       |

| Total water consumption | tonne          | –    | 35.00 |
| Intensity               | tonne/employee | –    | 1.67  |

Summary of water consumption and the Group's intensity performance is as follows:

### *Packaging Material*

Owing to the Group's business nature, the use of packaging material is not a material ESG aspect of the Group.

### **A3. The Environment and Natural Resources**

#### *Well Site Management and Environment Restoration*

During the Reporting Period, the Group employed its own local management team in Canada to manage the daily oilfield operations. For drilling operations, the local team prepares the drilling plan and completion jobs design and schedule, manage the overall progress, and engage different service provider/vendor to perform the drilling and completion jobs. Although most of the daily operations in the oilfield are carried out by service providers and vendors, the Group still strives to minimise the potential environmental impacts arising from its business through monitoring the work of the service providers and vendors. As far as the Group understands, the activities performed by the service providers/vendors were in material respects complied with the local environmental laws and regulations.

*Well Site Management and Environment Restoration (continued)*

The Group is aware of the potential impact of its petroleum exploration and production business on the environment and natural resources, and therefore attaches great importance to minimising its environmental impact where possible, and strictly complies with all relevant local environmentalrelated laws and regulations. The Group recognises its responsibility of preserving the oilfields and pursuing sustainable petroleum exploration and production practices. Accordingly, the Group has recognised a decommissioning obligation in accordance with the regulations as required by Alberta Energy Regulator which represents the cost for future abandonment of the oil and gas production equipment and facilities. This obligation includes facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation and site restoration. As of 31 December 2022, the Group was responsible for managing about 80 wells, of which 35 wells were presently active and producing hydrocarbons, and drilling works on three new wells were in progress with two were subsequently completed in January 2023 and one in February 2023. The Group has the responsibility to decommission and reclaim all the aforementioned well sites to their original land use. When the Group decides to permanently cease an operation at a well site, pipeline or facility, the asset must be decommissioned, remediated and reclaimed. The Group will take charge of this process, which involves two stages: (i) abandonment and (ii) reclamation. Upon abandonment of both the downhole and surface components and removal of all surface equipment, the well is considered as decommissioned. Once abandonment work is completed on a site, environmental assessments, remediation (if applicable) and reclamation activities can commence.

During the Reporting Period, the Group had completed abandonment work on two non-producing wells and a bundle of underground pipeline. The abandonment works have been verified and recognised by Alberta Energy Regulator.

The Group has consistently integrated its ESG goals and mission in its daily operations and implemented practices and procedures to preserve and improve the shared future. Other than the Group's petroleum exploration and production operation, the Group's other operations do not have significant impact on the environment and natural resources. The Group has always been actively bringing environmental responsibility into its daily operations, and encourages all staff to adopt environmentally responsible behaviour and raise awareness of environmental protection. As mentioned in the above sections, the Company has implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption, save water resources and reduce wastes. The Group strives to promote the use of clean and renewable energy, as promulgated by its solar energy business discussed below, with a view to contribute its efforts in building a greener environment.

#### *Fostering Renewable Clean Energy*

The Group has also invested in solar energy power generation projects that are participating in the FiT Scheme. Solar energy is a kind of clean, renewable and sustainable source of electricity which builds a greener environment. As of 31 December 2022, the Group has 40 solar photovoltaic systems in operations, and 10 solar photovoltaic systems are scheduled to be completed before the end of the first quarter of 2023. By expanding its footprints in renewable energy sector, the Group demonstrated its commitment to curb carbon emissions and contributed concerted efforts together with the government and the community to exploit renewable energy potential in Hong Kong.

#### *Indoor Air Quality*

The Group is committed to providing its employees with a pleasing working environment to enhance their work efficiency. For the Group's office-based operation in Hong Kong and Canada, its employees spend most of their working hours inside the office, implying that indoor air quality at workplace is of paramount importance. Therefore, indoor air quality is constantly monitored and improved by the utilisation of several measures. Such measures include cleaning air-conditioning systems regularly and choosing products with low or zero volatile organic compounds where applicable. By adopting these measures, indoor air quality of the Group's offices is maintained.

#### **A4. Climate Change**

Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and cause catastrophic damage. Climate change is also changing seasonal and annual patterns of temperature, precipitation, and other weather phenomena. The unprecedented crisis from the global spread of COVID-19 has created significant challenges worldwide while the risks of climate change are imminent. Understanding of these trends and their relationships with the Group's businesses can help the Group to prepare and analyse possible risks and opportunities, seize opportunities of potential benefits, and establish the response capacity of the Group in the long-run. The Group believes that a robust response to climate change requires concerted efforts of all stakeholders. Therefore, it will continuously identify and address stakeholders' expectations to optimise its environmental measures in order to achieve sustainable development and create long-term values for the stakeholders and society as a whole.

To handle the intensified threat of climate change, the Group has assessed the potential risks that may arise from its business operations. These risks mainly stem from the following dimensions:

#### *Physical Risks*

For physical risks, increase in severity of extreme weather events such as stronger typhoons and floods, may interrupt the water and electricity supplies, damage the Group's properties, as well as threaten the safety of the Group's employees. This may cause interruption to the normal business operations and thus have an adverse effect on the Group's financial performance.

The Group has implemented different measures to manage the abovementioned physical risks. For example, the Group maintains comprehensive insurance coverage on assets that are prone to damage by extreme weather conditions. In addition, the Group has established the practice of communicating the arrangements for extreme weather events to employees in advance. The Group recognises potential financial impacts can be minimised with adequate preparation for extreme weather events.

#### *Transition Risks*

For transition risks, the Group expects policies and regulations in relation to climate change will become increasingly stringent. If the Group's existing compliance procedures and business operations could not fully comply with the new legal and regulatory requirements, it might incur additional compliance costs and the reputation of the Group may also be adversely affected. In addition, the highcarbon emitting industry will suffer from higher cost, lower returns or asset devaluation. Related climate change risk might also impose an impact to the Group's investment and financing activities regarding related industries.

{65}------------------------------------------------

### **A. ENVIRONMENTAL (continued)**

### **A3. The Environment and Natural Resources (continued)**

### *Transition Risks (continued)*

To manage the above transition risks, the Group has implemented a series of measures. Firstly, the Group's management team regularly monitors existing and emerging climate-related trends, policies and regulations and seek compliance consulting services to reduce legal risks. Secondly, the Group has gradually incorporated sustainability into its business operations. Various measures have also been adopted to protect the environment, including measures aimed at reducing GHG emissions as well as resources conservation. Furthermore, with the aim to demonstrate the Group's commitment on promoting environmental protection, the Group has commenced its solar energy business to explore and capitalise on potential opportunities arising from the increasing awareness on environmental protection, as well as to advocate the global vision of decarbonisation by producing clean and renewable solar energy.

### **B. SOCIAL**

### **B1. Employment**

Connecting with the right people, building social capital and relationships, showing appreciation to staff members, suppliers and customers who keep the business running are the cornerstones of business success. The Group has observed the applicable laws and regulations of each business location relating to compensation and dismissal, recruitment and promotion, working hours, rest periods, equal opportunities, diversity, anti-discrimination, and other benefits and welfare, and has established relevant policies to ensure its employment practices strictly follows the principles of fairness, equality, competitiveness and non-discrimination in hiring outstanding talents.

During the Reporting Period, the Group was not aware of any material non-compliance with employment-related laws and regulations that would have a significant impact on the Group, including but not limited to the Employment Ordinance of Hong Kong and the Canadian Human Rights Act and Employment Standards Code of Canada.

#### *Employment and Labour Practices*

The Group's employees are critical for its continuing operations. The Group always views employees as the core assets of the Group for establishing the foundation of success and long-term development. When the Group formulates human resources strategies, it devotes to create an equitable, nondiscriminatory and safe working environment. It strives to build a harmonious working environment for employees based on mutual respect, trust, impartiality, transparency and truthfulness, dynamism and teamwork to encourage creativity, flexibility and commitment to accomplish the corporate mission.

#### *Staff Training and Promotion Opportunity*

The Group provides equal opportunities to employees to capture, promote and retain talents and promote personal and professional growth by offering them attractive and commensurate remuneration packages as well as providing various career development training. Ongoing education and training for employees in relation to ethical conduct, roles and responsibilities, specific skills, and technological and market development are very important to nurturing talents, as are performance feedback and appraisals from direct manager to uncover potentials of employees and offer competitive remuneration packages to retain competent staff. In addition, the Group strictly complies with the relevant laws and regulations in hiring employees.

#### *Staff Training and Promotion Opportunity (continued)*

The Group devotes to protect human right and privacy of employees. It selects the best qualified candidates by considering various criteria such as education background, relevant work experience, demonstrated knowledge, competencies and skills, desirable personal traits, physical fitness and development potential.

#### *Anti-discrimination Measures*

The Group gives equal opportunity for employment to all individuals, regardless of their race, religion, colour, nationality, age, marital status, gender, sexual orientation or disability. This applies to all phases of the employment relationships, including but not limited to recruitment, promotion, dismissal, personal development opportunities and determining wages and benefits. Diversity is the strength of the Group, and therefore every employee must respect the people and cultures with whom or in which they work. The Group endeavours to seek diversity at all levels and expect a work environment in which all employees can develop and contribute to their full potential, and strives to achieve a win-win situation through joint development of employees and the Group.

### *Occupational Health and Workplace Safety*

The Group established strict risk assessment and management policies and procedures to identify and minimise potential hazard that might lead to injury, illness or human loss by providing staff training and planning in advance for the coordinated action in case of emergency. The policies and procedures provide clear and identified guidelines for staff to identify and assess risks, delineate procedures for handling situations involving security and safety of workers and facilities, carefully plan for business operations (including tools required for eliminating or controlling risks) and promote good working atmosphere. The Group aims to maintain and practise the highest standards in terms of preventing incidents and potential accidents by developing specific procedures, as well as identify, assess and minimise risks by scheduling operations performing in the work field.

The Group provides on-the-job technical training regularly, arranges safety assessment and organises teambuilding activities to promote job safety. This is to ensure that employees are equipped with the required knowledge and skills to fulfil their job duties and able to meet the safety standards.

The Group also has insurance policies in place for injuries at work for every employee. It cares about occupational health and safety programmes as they strengthen safety awareness and self protecting tendencies of employees and maintain a safe production environment.

The Group believes that good working relationship among staff can minimise hazards within the operation site. The Group sets up comprehensive contingency plan detailing the handling procedures for different types of contingencies (fires, electrical failure, flood and water damage, earthquakes, typhoons, heavy rains, etc.) When a contingency occurs, the procedure starts by notifying through any available media, according to the employees' emergency roles. The primary purpose of the business contingency plan is to safeguard assets of the Group such as physical safety and mental well-being of human life, to establish and resume critical functions as quickly as possible by providing an alternate processing site and to re-establish critical functions of the Group. A responsible personnel is designated for coordinating and supervising the work necessary during and after the incident.

The Group also establishes and optimises its occupational health management system to protect workers and their rights. The Group provides all site workers in oilfield with safety protective equipment such as protective gloves, shock-proof glasses, hearing protectors, fire resistant jacket, helmet, boots with toes and ankles protection, working clothes, etc. in sufficient quantity and quality and the use of the safety protective equipment is mandatory, in accordance with the instructions issued by the Group. All personnel involved in the operation and within the scope of the location are responsible for the use of safety protective equipment which must be suitable to perform the work. In addition, prior to the start-up of any operational task within or outside the location, a meeting with the involved staff present on location is conducted to give knowledge of the involved manoeuvres, identified risks and scope or needs that are required to complete such an operation.

### **Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of EPI (Holdings) Limited 長盈集團(控股)有限公司** *(Incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability)*

### **OPINION**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of EPI (Holdings) Limited (the "**Company**") and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "**Group**") set out on pages 84 to 169, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2022, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards ("**HKFRSs**") issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("**HKICPA**") and have been properly prepared in compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

### **BASIS FOR OPINION**

We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing ("**HKSAs**") issued by the HKICPA. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the HKICPA's Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the "**Code**"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

{79}------------------------------------------------

### **KEY AUDIT MATTERS**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

#### **Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

#### *Impairment assessment of loan and interest receivables*

We identified the impairment assessment of loan and interest receivables as a key audit matter due to the significance of balances to the Group's consolidated financial position and the involvement of significant management judgment in evaluating the expected credit losses ("**ECL**") of loan and interest receivables at the end of the reporting period.

As detailed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in making the assessment, the loan and interest receivables from borrowers are assessed individually by the management of the Group, based on the financial background, financial condition, collaterals and historical settlement records, including the past due dates and probability of default, of each borrower and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Each borrower is assigned a risk grading under internal credit ratings to calculate the ECL, taking into consideration of the estimates of expected cash shortfalls. At every reporting date, the financial background, financial condition, collaterals and historical settlement records are reassessed and changes in the forward-looking information are considered.

Our procedures in relation to management's impairment assessment of loan receivables included:

- Understanding and evaluating the entity's key controls on the related credit control and loan monitoring process and how the management estimates the credit loss allowance for loan receivables and performs loan monitoring process;
- E v a l u a t i n g t h e r e a s o n a b l e n e s s a n d appropriateness of the management's assessment of the internal credit rating of the loan receivables by reference to past due status, past collection history, financial background and financial condition of the borrowers; and

{80}------------------------------------------------

#### **Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

#### *Impairment assessment of loan and interest receivables (continued)*

- The management further assesses the amount of exposure of default to assess the potential loss as a result of the risk on credit-impaired loan and interest receivables to which the Group is exposed and take appropriate corrective actions. In assessing the amount of exposure of default, the Group takes into account the timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collaterals less the costs of selling the collaterals.
The gross carrying amount of the loan and interest receivables is HK\$84,652,000 in aggregate and the impairment allowance on loan and interest receivables is HK\$23,800,000 in aggregate as at 31 December 2022 as set out in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.

- E v a l u a t i n g t h e r e a s o n a b l e n e s s a n d appropriateness on the management's basis and judgment in determining credit loss allowance on loan receivables at 31 December 2022, including the identification of credit-impaired loan receivables, the estimated loss rates applied to each borrower, and the estimated cash flow from the realisation of collaterals pledged to the Group, with the assistance of our internal valuation specialists.

{81}------------------------------------------------

#### **Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter**

#### *Provision for ECL for debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income ("***FVTOCI***")*

We identified provision for ECL for debt instruments at FVTOCI as a key audit matter because the determination of loss allowance for debt instruments at FVTOCI using the ECL model involves significant estimates and judgments, including determination of whether there is significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, use of assumptions in determination of probability of default and loss given default, and incorporation of forward-looking information.

As disclosed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the fair value of debt instruments at FVTOCI is HK\$33,739,000 at 31 December 2022 and the impairment allowance of HK\$11,081,000 is recognised in profit or loss with corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income for the current year. The determination of loss allowances is dependent on the external macro environment and the credit rating of each debt security. The management also takes into consideration of historical data from the international rating agency. The Group had engaged an independent professional valuer to perform ECL assessment.

Our procedures in relation to ECL for debt instruments at FVTOCI on the consolidated financial instruments included:

- Understanding and assessing the design and implementation of key internal controls of the credit grading process and measurement of loss allowances;
- Evaluating methodology and assumptions used by management in determining ECL; and
- Engaging our internal specialists to review the significant management judgments and assumptions, including (i) the criteria for significant increase in credit risk made by assessing credit rating migration between origination date and reporting date; (ii) reasonableness of probability of default, recovery rate and loss given default; and (iii) the use of economic variables and relative weighting for forward-looking scenarios.

### **OTHER INFORMATION**

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

### **RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

{83}------------------------------------------------

### **AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 90 of the Bermuda Companies Act, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

{84}------------------------------------------------

### **AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

For the year ended 31 December 2022

### **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

### **3.1 Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA. For the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements information is considered material if such information is reasonably expected to influence decisions made by primary users. In addition, the consolidated financial statements include applicable disclosures required by the Listing Rules and by the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies set out below.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of HKFRS 2 "Share-based payment", leasing transactions that are accounted for in accordance with HKFRS 16, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in HKAS 2 "Inventories" or value in use in HKAS 36 "Impairment of assets".

For financial instruments which are transacted at fair value and a valuation technique that unobservable inputs are to be used to measure fair value in subsequent periods, the valuation technique is calibrated so that at initial recognition the results of the valuation technique equals the transaction price.

{95}------------------------------------------------

For the year ended 31 December 2022

# **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

- **3.1 Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements (continued)**
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;
- Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
- Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

- has power over the investee;
- is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
- has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

{96}------------------------------------------------

For the year ended 31 December 2022

### **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

#### **Basis of consolidation (continued)**

Profit or loss and each item of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group's accounting policies.

All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group's equity therein, which represent present ownership entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets of the relevant subsidiaries upon liquidation.

#### *Changes in the Group's interests in existing subsidiaries*

When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are derecognised. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary attributable to the owners of the Company. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable HKFRSs).

#### **Interests in subsidiaries**

Interests in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment loss.

#### **Investment in joint operations**

A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with the HKFRSs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

{97}------------------------------------------------

For the year ended 31 December 2022

# **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

**Investment in joint operations (continued)**

When a group entity transacts with a joint operation in which a group entity is a joint operator (such as a sale or contribution of assets), the Group is considered to be conducting the transaction with the other parties to the joint operation, and gains and losses resulting from the transactions are recognised in the Group's consolidated financial statements only to the extent of other parties' interests in the joint operation.

When a group entity transacts with a joint operation in which a group entity is a joint operator (such as a purchase of assets), the Group does not recognise its share of the gains and losses until it resells those assets to a third party.

#### **Revenue from contracts with customers**

The Group recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e. when "control" of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.

A performance obligation represents a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same.

Control is transferred over time and revenue is recognised over time by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation if one of the following criteria is met:

- the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs;
- the Group's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the Group performs; or
- the Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the distinct good or service.

For the year ended 31 December 2022

### **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

**Revenue from contracts with customers (continued)**

Over time revenue recognition: measurement of progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation

### *Output method*

The progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured based on output method, which is to recognise revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value of the goods or services transferred to the customer to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract, that best depict the Group's performance in transferring control of goods or services.

As a practical expedient, if the Group has a right to invoice as the amount represents and corresponds directly with the value of performance completed and transferred to the customers.

Dividend income is recognised when the Group's right to receive the dividend is established.

#### **Leases**

#### *Definition of a lease*

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

For contracts entered into or modified on or after the date of initial application of HKFRS 16 or arising from business combinations, the Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition under HKFRS 16 at inception, modification date or acquisition date, as appropriate. Such contract will not be reassessed unless the terms and conditions of the contract are subsequently changed.

#### *The Group as a lessee*

#### *Allocation of consideration to components of a contract*

For a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.

#### *Short-term leases*

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to leases of buildings that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis or another systematic basis over the lease term.

## **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

- **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**
**Leases (continued)** *The Group as a lessee (continued) Right-of-use assets* The cost of right-of-use asset includes:

- the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; and
- any initial direct costs incurred by the Group.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.

The Group presents right-of-use assets as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

### *Refundable rental deposits*

Refundable rental deposits paid are accounted under HKFRS 9 "Financial instruments" ("**HKFRS 9**") and initially measured at fair value. Adjustments to fair value at initial recognition are considered as additional lease payments and included in the cost of right-of-use assets.

#### *Lease liabilities*

At the commencement date of a lease, the Group recognises and measures the lease liability at the present value of lease payments that are unpaid at that date. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable.

After the commencement date, lease liabilities are adjusted by interest accretion and lease payments.

The Group presents lease liabilities as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of financial position.

### **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

- **Intangible asset**
*Intangible asset acquired separately*

Intangible asset, including vehicle license, with indefinite useful lives that is acquired separately is carried at cost less any subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

#### **Property, plant and equipment**

#### *Oil and gas properties*

Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of commercially proven development wells, is capitalised within construction in progress under property, plant and equipment. When development is completed on a specific field, it is transferred to oil and gas properties. No depreciation is charged during the development phase.

Oil and gas production properties include drilling costs, exploration and evaluation costs, development costs and other direct costs attributable to the oil and gas production properties.

Oil and gas properties are depreciated and depleted using the unit-of-production method. Unit-of-production rates are based on oil and gas reserves, which are oil, gas and other mineral reserves estimated to be recovered from existing facilities using current operating methods. Oil and gas volumes are considered to be part of production once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the field storage tank.

Property, plant and equipment, including oil and gas properties, are stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

For the year ended 31 December 2022

# **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment (continued)**

*Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas properties*

Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas properties are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost less subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Constructions in progress in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Costs include any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group's accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their residual values over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.

#### **Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets**

At the end of the reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets to determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the relevant asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets are estimated individually. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount individually, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

{102}------------------------------------------------

For the year ended 31 December 2022

### **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

**Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets (continued)**

In testing a cash generating unit for impairment, corporate assets are allocated to the relevant cash-generating units when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be established, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be established. The recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which the corporate asset belongs, and is compared with the carrying amount of the relevant cashgenerating unit or group of cash-generating units.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset (or a cash-generating unit) for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or a cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. For corporate assets or portion of corporate assets which cannot be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to a cash-generating unit, the Group compares the carrying amount of a group of cash-generating units, including the carrying amounts of the corporate assets or portion of corporate assets allocated to that group of cash-generating units, with the recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units. In allocating the impairment loss, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill (if applicable) and then to the other assets on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit or the group of cash-generating units. The carrying amount of an asset is not reduced below the highest of its fair value less costs of disposal (if measurable), its value in use (if determinable) and zero. The amount of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated to the asset is allocated pro rata to the other assets of the unit or the group of cashgenerating units. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cashgenerating unit or a group of cash-generating units) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

### **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

### **Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is material).

### **Decommissioning obligation**

Decommissioning obligation represents cost for the future abandonment of oil and gas production equipment and facilities, representing the legal obligations, at the end of their economic lives. Decommissioning activities may include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation, and site restoration.

The amount recognised as part of the cost of oil and gas properties is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value. The timing and amount of future expenditure are reviewed annually together with the interest rate to be used in discounting the cash flows. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is dealt with prospectively and reflected as an adjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment – oil and gas properties.

Decommissioning costs are depreciated as part of the cost of oil and gas properties using the unit-of-production method. The accretion of discount of the provision of decommissioning cost is recognised as finance costs in the consolidated profit or loss.

### **Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value except for trade receivables arising from contracts with customers which are initially measured in accordance with HKFRS 15 "Revenue from contracts with customers". Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets at fair value through profit or loss ("**FVTPL**")) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at FVTPL are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

**Financial instruments (continued)** *Effective interest method*

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability and of allocating interest income and interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts and payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Interest and dividend income which are derived from the Group's ordinary course of business are presented as revenue.

#### *Financial assets*

*Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets*

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost:

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ("**FVTOCI**"):

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both selling and collecting contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

All other financial assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL, except that at initial recognition of a financial asset of the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment in other comprehensive income ("**OCI**") if that equity investment is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which HKFRS 3 "Business combinations" applies.

- **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued) Financial instruments (continued)** *Financial assets (continued) Classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets (continued)* A financial asset is held for trading if:
	- it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term; or
	- on initial recognition it is a part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
	- it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.

In addition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that are required to be measured at the amortised cost or FVTOCI as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.

- *(i)* Amortised cost and interest income
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method for financial assets measured subsequently at amortised cost and debt instruments subsequently measured at FVTOCI. Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired. For financial assets that have subsequently become creditimpaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from the next reporting period. If the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset from the beginning of the reporting period following the determination that the asset is no longer credit-impaired.

- *(ii)* Debt instruments classified as at FVTOCI
Subsequent changes in the carrying amounts for debt instruments classified as at FVTOCI as a result of interest income calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss. All other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognised in OCI and accumulated under the heading of investment revaluation reserve. Impairment allowances are recognised in profit or loss with corresponding adjustment to OCI without reducing the carrying amounts of these debt instruments. When these debt instruments are derecognised, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.

#### *(iii)* Financial assets at FVTPL

Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI or designated as FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL.

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with any fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss excludes any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the "net loss on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss" line item.

#### *Impairment of financial assets and other items subject to impairment assessment under HKFRS 9*

The Group performs impairment assessment under expected credit loss ("**ECL**") model on financial assets (including trade and other receivables, loan and interest receivables, cash and cash equivalents and debt instruments at FVTOCI) which are subject to impairment assessment under HKFRS 9. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.

Lifetime ECL represents the ECL that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of the relevant instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL ("**12m ECL**") represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Assessments are done based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current conditions at the reporting date as well as the forecast of future conditions.

The Group always recognises lifetime ECL for trade receivables. The ECL is assessed individually for trade receivables.

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

**Financial instruments (continued)**

*Financial assets (continued)*

*Impairment of financial assets and other items subject to impairment assessment under HKFRS 9 (continued)*

For all other instruments, the Group measures the loss allowance equal to 12m ECL, unless when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition in which case, the Group recognises lifetime ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognised is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition.

- *(i)* Significant increase in credit risk
In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort.

In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly:

- an actual or expected significant deterioration in the financial instrument's external (if available) or internal credit rating;
- significant deterioration in external market indicators of credit risk, e. g. a significant increase in the credit spread, the credit default swap prices for the debtor;
- existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant decrease in the debtor's ability to meet its debt obligations;
- an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor;
- an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor's ability to meet its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

*Financial assets (continued)*

*Impairment of financial assets and other items subject to impairment assessment under HKFRS 9 (continued)*

#### *(i)* Significant increase in credit risk (continued)

Despite the aforegoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a debt instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the debt instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A debt instrument is determined to have low credit risk if (i) it has a low risk of default, (ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and (iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. The Group considers a debt instrument to have low credit risk when it has an internal or external credit rating of 'investment grade' as per globally understood definitions or the counterparty can meet the financial commitment.

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.

#### *(ii)* Definition of default

For internal credit risk management, the Group considers an event of default occurs when information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collaterals held by the Group).

Irrespective of the above, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

*Impairment of financial assets and other items subject to impairment assessment under HKFRS 9 (continued)*

### *(iii)* Credit-impaired financial assets

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:

- significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;
- a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;
- the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;
- the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or
- the issuer engaging in business that are unstable
- *(iv)* Write-off policy

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, for example, when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or in the case of trade receivables, when the amounts are over two years past due, whichever occurs sooner. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group's recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event. Any subsequent recoveries are recognised in profit or loss.

#### *(v)* Measurement and recognition of ECL

The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted and forward-looking information. Estimation of ECL reflects an unbiased and probabilityweighted amount that is determined with the respective risks of default occurring as the weights.

Generally, the ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition.

Where ECL is measured on a collective basis or cater for cases where evidence at the individual instrument level may not yet be available, the financial instruments are grouped on the following basis:

- Nature of financial instruments (i.e. the Group's other receivables are assessed as a separate group);
- Past-due status;
- Nature, size and industry of debtors; and
- External credit ratings where available.

The grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure the constituents of each group continue to share similar credit risk characteristics.

Interest income is calculated based on the gross carrying amount of the financial asset unless the financial asset is credit-impaired, in which case interest income is calculated based on amortised cost of the financial asset.

#### *(v)* Measurement and recognition of ECL (continued)

For trade receivables and loan receivables, the ECL of the Group is recognised through a loss allowance account. Impairment allowances are recognised in profit or loss with corresponding adjustment to OCI without reducing the carrying amounts of these debt instruments.

#### *Derecognition of financial assets*

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss.

On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument classified as at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.

**Financial instruments (continued)** *Financial liabilities and equity*

*Classification as debt or equity*

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

#### *Equity instruments*

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

#### *Financial liabilities*

All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

#### *Financial liabilities at amortised cost*

Financial liabilities including trade and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.

#### *Derecognition of financial liabilities*

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in profit or loss.

#### **Taxation**

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

#### *Current tax*

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit (loss) before tax because of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

# **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

### **3.2 Significant accounting policies (continued)**

**Taxation (continued)**

#### *Deferred tax*

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint operations, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rate (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

For the purposes of measuring deferred tax for leasing transactions in which the Group recognises the right-of-use assets and the related lease liabilities, the Group first determines whether the tax deductions are attributable to the right-of-use assets or the lease liabilities.

### **3. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Taxation (continued)**

*Deferred tax (continued)*

For leasing transactions in which the tax deductions are attributable to the lease liabilities, the Group applies HKAS 12 "Income taxes" requirements to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities separately. Temporary differences on initial recognition of the relevant right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recognised due to application of the initial recognition exemption. Temporary differences arising from subsequent revision of the carrying amounts of rightof-use assets and lease liabilities, resulting from remeasurement of lease liabilities and lease modifications, that are not subject to initial recognition exemption are recognised on the date of remeasurement or modification.

#### *Current and deferred tax for the year*

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied to the same taxable entity by the same taxation authority.

Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in OCI or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in OCI or directly in equity respectively.

In assessing any uncertainty over income tax treatments, the Group considers whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority will accept the uncertain tax treatment used, or proposed to be used by individual group entities in their income tax filings. If it is probable, the current and deferred taxes are determined consistently with the tax treatment in the income tax filings. If it is not probable that the relevant taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of each uncertainty is reflected by using either the most likely amount or the expected value.

#### **Employee benefits**

#### *Retirement benefits costs*

Payments to state-managed retirement benefit schemes and Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme ("**MPF Scheme**") and the Canada Pension Fund are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

**Employee benefits (continued)**

*Short-term and other long-term employee benefits*

Short-term employee benefits are recognised at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid as and when employees rendered the services. All short-term employee benefits are recognised as an expense unless another HKFRS requires or permits the inclusion of the benefit in the cost of an asset.

A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees (such as wages and salaries and annual leave) after deducting any amount already paid.

Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Any changes in the liabilities' carrying amounts resulting from service cost, interest and remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that another HKFRS requires or permits their inclusion in the cost of an asset.

**Share-based payments**

*Equity-settled share-based payment transactions*

### *Share options granted to employees and directors*

Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and directors providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date.

The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments determined at the grant date without taking into consideration all non-market vesting conditions is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity (share options reserve). At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest based on assessment of all relevant non-market vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the share options reserve. For share options that vest immediately at the date of grant, the fair value of the share options granted is expensed immediately to profit or loss.

When share options are exercised, the amount previously recognised in share-based payments reserve will be transferred to share premium. When the share options are forfeited after the vesting date or are still not exercised at the expiry date, the amount previously recognised in share options reserve will continue to be held in share options reserve.

#### **Government grants**

Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants related to income that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable. Such grants are presented under "other income and losses, net".

#### **Foreign currencies**

In preparing the financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of that entity (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchanges prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At the end of the reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

For the purposes of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group (i.e. HK\$) using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expenses items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during the period, in which case, the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity under the heading of translation reserve.

### **Business combinations or asset acquisitions**

#### *Optional concentration test*

The Group can elect to apply an optional concentration test, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. The gross assets under assessment exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities. If the concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business and no further assessment is needed.

#### *Asset acquisitions*

When the Group acquires a group of assets and liabilities that do not constitute a business, the Group identifies and recognises the individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by allocating the purchase price first to financial assets/financial liabilities at the respective fair values, the remaining balance of the purchase price is then allocated to the other identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of purchase. Such a transaction does not give rise to goodwill or bargain purchase gain.

### **4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENT AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY**

In the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the directors of the Company are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

### **Critical judgments in applying accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgments, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that the directors of the Company have made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

### *Judgment on whether there has been significant increase in credit risk in respect of the Group's financial assets*

The management assesses whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for exposures since initial recognition in respect of the Group's loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI. If there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group will measure the loss allowance based on lifetime ECL rather than 12-month ECL. In assessing whether the credit risk of an asset has significantly increased, the Group takes into account qualitative factors and quantitative modelling to support reasonable and supportable forward-looking information available without undue cost or effort with significant judgments involved. The Group determines individually whether the loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI have been credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows have occurred. In addition, judgement is involved to assess whether a change in the contractual terms of the Group's loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI would lead to (1) an increase in credit risk; and (2) the need to derecognise the existing loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI and recognise new loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI. The information about the ECL and the Group's loan and interest receivables and debt instruments at FVTOCI are disclosed in Notes 37, 22 and 21 respectively.

### **Key sources of estimation uncertainty**

The following is the key assumption concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

### *Provision of ECL for loan and interest receivables*

Management regularly reviews the impairment assessment and evaluates the ECL of the loan and interest receivables. Appropriate impairment allowance is recognised in profit or loss.

In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the one as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the loan and interest receivables from borrowers are assessed individually by the management of the Group, based on the financial background, financial condition and the historical settlement records, including past due dates and default rates, of each borrower and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information (such as macroeconomic factors including Gross Domestic Product ("**GDP**") growth and unemployment rate with adjustment on different scenarios of economic environment prospect) that is available without undue cost or effort.

Each borrower is assigned a risk grading under internal credit ratings to calculate the ECL, taking into consideration of the estimates of expected cash shortfalls which are driven by estimates of possibility of default and the amount and timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collaterals (if any) less the costs of selling the collaterals. At every reporting date, the financial background, financial condition and the historical settlement records are reassessed and changes in the forwardlooking information are considered.

The management further assesses the amount of exposure of default to assess the potential loss as a result of the risk on credit-impaired loan and interest receivables to which the Group is exposed and take appropriate corrective actions. In assessing the amount of exposure of default, the Group takes into account the timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collaterals less the costs of selling the collaterals.

The provision of ECL is sensitive to changes in estimates. Owing to greater financial uncertainty triggered by the COVID epidemic, the Group has increased the expected loss rates in the current year as there is higher risk that a prolonged pandemic could led to increased credit default rates. The information about the ECL and the Group's loan and interest receivables are disclosed in Notes 37 and 22 respectively.

### **Key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)**

### *Debt instrument at FVTOCI*

The Group's debts instruments at FVTOCI are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling of these assets and the contractual cash flows of these investments are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

### *Provision of ECL for debt instruments at FVTOCI*

The Group performed impairment assessment for debt instruments at FVTOCI under ECL model individually. The determination of the loss allowances is dependent on the external macro environment and the credit rating of each debt securities. The management takes into consideration historical data from the international rating agency.

The Group determines individually whether the issuers of the debt instruments have been credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows have occurred. Evidence that the debt instruments at FVTOCI are credit-impaired includes observable data including significant financial difficulty of the issuer; and the issuer is engaging in business that is unstable.

The provision of ECL involves significant estimates and judgments, including determination of whether there is significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, use of assumptions in determination of probability of default and loss given default, incorporation of forward looking information. The information about the ECL and the Group's financial assets are disclosed in Notes 37 and 21 respectively.

At 31 December 2022, the carrying amounts of debt instruments at FVTOCI was HK\$33,739,000 (2021: HK\$78,396,000) with provision of ECL of HK\$11,081,000 (2021: HK\$49,247,000) recognised during the year.

#### *Estimated impairment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets*

Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are stated at costs less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. In determining whether an asset is impaired, the Group has to exercise judgment and make estimation, particularly in assessing whether an event has occurred or any indicators that may affect the recoverable amount of the assets. In estimating the value in use, the net present value of future cash flows which are estimated based upon the continued use of the asset and key assumptions applied, including cash flow projections and an appropriate discount rate. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset (including right-of-use assets), the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the assets belongs, including allocation of corporate assets when a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be established, otherwise recoverable amount is determined at the smallest group of cash generating units, for which the relevant corporate assets have been allocated. Changing the assumptions and estimates, including the discount rates or the growth rate in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the recoverable amounts.

### **5. REVENUE (continued)**

### **Revenue from major products and services (continued)**

During the year, revenue from sales of petroleum was recognised at a point in time. Revenue from sales of petroleum was recognised once the control of the crude oil was transferred from the Group to the customer. Revenue was measured based on the oil price agreed with the customers at the point of sales.

During the year, revenue from sales of electricity was recognised at a point in time when the electricity generated (by solar energy power generation systems) and transmitted was simultaneously received and consumed by the power companies under the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff Scheme (the "**FiT Scheme**"), jointly launched by the Hong Kong Government and the two power companies in Hong Kong. The Group has no unsatisfied performance obligations at each reporting date.

Dividend income and interest income fall outside the scope of HKFRS 15.

Under the two-tiered profits tax rates regime of Hong Kong, the first HK\$2 million of profits of the qualifying group entity will be taxed at 8.25%, and profits above HK\$2 million will be taxed at 16.5%. The profits of group entities not qualifying for the two-tiered profits tax rates regime will continue to be taxed at a flat rate of 16.5%. Accordingly, the Hong Kong profits tax of the qualifying group entity is calculated at 8.25% on the first HK\$2 million of the estimated assessable profits and at 16.5% on the estimated assessable profits above HK\$2 million.

Under the Law of the PRC on Enterprise Income Tax (the "**EIT Law**") and Implementation Regulation of the EIT Law, the tax rate of the PRC subsidiaries is 25% for both years.

For the year ended 31 December 2021, the solar photovoltaic systems were depreciated on a straight-line basis of 5% per annum. With effect from 1 January 2022, the solar photovoltaic systems have been depreciated on a straightline basis until the end of the validity period of the FiT scheme, i.e. 31 December 2033. The change in depreciation rate has increased the depreciation charge for the year by HK\$987,000.
- *(iii)* The amount represented the construction in progress of new oil wells and other production enhancement works on oil wells in Canada, which are expected to be completed within a year. The construction in progress of solar photovoltaic systems in Hong Kong had been completed and reclassified as solar photovoltaic systems.

### **19. RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS (continued)**

For both years, the Group leases offices and buildings for its operations. Lease contracts are entered into for a fixed term of one to twelve years, but may have termination option as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period, the Group applies the definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable.

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, there were no outstanding lease commitments relating to short-term leases for office as disclosed above.

The Group has termination option in certain leases for its offices and buildings. Termination option is used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. The termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessor. The Group reassessed the lease term at the reporting date and concluded not to exercise the termination options and hence the related lease payments during the lease period were included in the lease liabilities.

#### **Restrictions or covenants on leases**

The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessors. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

- *(ii)* The amount represented prepayment for the acquisition of solar photovoltaic systems in relation to the Group's solar energy business, which would be utilised as consideration upon completion of the acquisition. The management expects the acquisition would be completed within one year.
- *(iii)* The Group allows an average credit period of 30 to 60 days (2021: 30 to 60 days). The trade receivables of HK\$5,232,000 (2021: HK\$194,000) were aged within 30 days based on the customers' statement date and were neither past due nor impaired.

Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customer's credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Credit limit and credit quality attributed to customers are reviewed by the management regularly.

Details of impairment assessment of trade receivables are set out in Note 37.

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, the fair values of debt instruments at FVTOCI were determined based on quoted market prices and credit risk adjustments on certain debt instruments.

The Group had engaged an independent professional valuer to perform ECL assessment on the debt instruments. The Company's management worked closely with the independent professional valuer to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model for ECL assessment. In making that evaluation, the Group assessed ECL for debt instruments at FVTOCI by reference to the credit rating of the debt instruments estimated by the recognised rating agencies (i.e. Moody's, Fitch), the macroeconomic factors and the changes in market conditions affecting each issuer, and the probability of default and loss given default of each debt instrument. The Group also took into account forwardlooking information that was reasonably and supportably available to the Group without undue cost or effort, including information such as GDP growth rate and unemployment rate.

Before granting loans to borrowers, the Group uses internal credit assessment process to assess the potential borrowers' credit quality individually and defines the credit limits granted to the borrowers. The credit limits attributed to the borrowers are reviewed by the management regularly.

### **Impairment assessment**

In assessing whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument at the reporting date with the risk perceived at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the loan and interest receivables from borrowers are assessed individually by the management of the Group, based on the financial background, financial condition and historical settlement records, including past due dates and probability of default, of each borrower and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Each borrower is assigned a risk grading under internal credit ratings to calculate the ECL, taking into consideration the estimates of expected cash shortfalls which are driven by estimates of possibility of default and the expected loss given default including taking into account the amount and timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collaterals (if any) less the costs of selling the collaterals. At every reporting date, the financial background, financial condition and historical settlement records of each borrower are reassessed and changes in the forward-looking information are considered.

In the event of default, the Group might take possession of assets held as collateral through court proceeding or voluntary delivery of possession by the borrower. The credit quality review process enables the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risk to which it is exposed and take appropriate corrective actions.

At 31 December 2022, of the Group's loan and interest receivables with aggregate gross carrying amount of HK\$84,652,000 (2021: HK\$149,916,000), (i) HK\$15,062,000 (2021: HK\$57,572,000) were not past due; (ii) nil (2021: HK\$34,134,000) had been past due for less than 30 days; (iii) HK\$12,500,000 (2021: HK\$537,000) had been past due for more than 30 days but less than 90 days; and (iv) HK\$57,090,000 (2021: HK\$57,673,000) had been past due for 90 days or more. The directors of the Company considered those secured loan and interest receivables that were past due for more than 90 days and unsecured loan and interest receivables that were past due for more than 30 days as creditimpaired, details of the cumulative ECL provided are set out above.

The Group recognised impairment allowance of HK\$20,019,000 (2021: reversal of impairment allowance of HK\$4,356,000) on loan and interest receivables for the current year.

Unless otherwise cancelled or amended, the Share Option Scheme will be valid and effective for a period of ten years commencing on the date of adoption. The purpose of the Share Option Scheme is to enable the Group to grant options to the participants as incentives or rewards for their contribution to the Group or any entity in which the Group holds any equity interest (the "**Invested Entity**"). Eligible participants of the Share Option Scheme include any employees of any member of the Group or any Invested Entity; any directors (including executive, non-executive and independent non-executive directors) of any member of the Group or any Invested Entity; any supplier of goods or services to any member of the Group or any Invested Entity; any customer of any member of the Group or any Invested Entity; any person or entity that provides research, development or other technological support to any member of the Group or any Invested Entity; any consultant or adviser of any member of the Group or any Invested Entity; and any shareholder of any member of the Group or any Invested Entity or any holder of any securities issued by any member of the Group or any Invested Entity.

The offer of a grant of share options shall remain open for acceptance by the participant concerned for a period of fifteen (15) business days from the date of grant provided that no such offer shall be open for acceptance after the expiry of the option period or after the Share Option Scheme has been terminated. The amount payable by each grantee of options to the Company on acceptance of the offer for the grant of options is HK\$1.00.

### **31. SHARE OPTION SCHEME (continued)**

The subscription price for the shares on the exercise of options under the Share Option Scheme shall be a price determined by the Board in its absolute discretion at the time of the grant of the relevant option (and shall be stated in the letter containing the offer of the grant of the option) but in any case the subscription price shall not be less than the higher of: (i) the closing price of the shares as stated in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's daily quotations sheet on the date of grant which must be a business day; (ii) the average closing price of the shares as stated in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's daily quotations sheets for the five business days immediately preceding the date of grant; and (iii) the nominal value of the share. The exercise period of the share options granted is determined by the Board but in any event, no longer than ten years from the date of grant.

The total number of shares issued and to be issued upon exercise of the options granted to each participant, together with all options granted and to be granted to the participant under any other share option scheme(s) of the Company within the 12-month period immediately preceding the proposed date of grant (including exercised, cancelled and outstanding options) shall not exceed 1% of the total number of the shares in issue at the proposed date of grant. Any further grant of options to a participant in excess of the 1% limit shall be subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders with such participant and the participant's associates abstaining from voting.

The limit on the total number of shares which may be issued upon exercise of all outstanding options granted and yet to be exercised under the Share Option Scheme and any other share option scheme(s) of the Company must not exceed 30% of the total number of the shares in issue from time to time. In addition, the total number of the shares which may be issued upon exercise of all options to be granted under the Share Option Scheme, together with all options to be granted under any other share option scheme(s) of the Company (excluding lapsed options), must not represent more than 10% of the total number of the shares in issue at the date of approval of the Share Option Scheme (the "**Scheme Mandate Limit**") or at the date of the approval of the refreshed Scheme Mandate Limit as the case maybe.

On 4 May 2017, the Company granted share options to eligible persons to subscribe for a total of 436,710,000 ordinary shares of the Company under the Share Option Scheme. The exercise price of the options granted is HK\$0.53 per share and the exercisable period was from 4 May 2017 to 3 May 2020 (both dates inclusive).

On 4 May 2020, all the outstanding share options were lapsed.

At the annual general meeting of the Company held on 29 June 2021, the shareholders of the Company approved the refreshment of the Scheme Mandate Limit (the "**Scheme Mandate Limit Refreshment**"). The total number of shares of the Company available for issue under the Share Option Scheme is 524,034,404 shares as refreshed, representing approximately 10% of the issued shares of the Company as at the date of approval of the Scheme Mandate Limit Refreshment and at the date of this annual report.

At 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, there were no outstanding share options.

### **32. ACQUISITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**

On 9 February 2022, the Group entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with RockEast Energy Corp. for the acquisition of an operating oilfield which comprises petroleum and natural gas rights, facilities and pipelines, together with all other properties and assets located in Alberta Province in Canada ("**Canadian Oil Assets**"). On 16 July 2022, the acquisition of the Canadian Oil Assets was completed. The directors of the Company have elected to apply the optional concentration test in accordance with HKFRS 3 and concluded that the transaction was an acquisition of assets and liabilities as the Canadian Oil Assets are concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets of similar nature. In addition, the directors of the Company are also of the opinion that the Canadian Oil Assets is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows.

Details of the acquisition are summarised as follows:

|                                                                                     | HK\$'000 |

#### **Interest rate risk**

The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk in relation to loan and interest receivables, debt instruments at FVTOCI and lease liabilities. The Group is also exposed to cash flow interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group's short-term deposits placed with banks and variable-rate bank balances that are interest-bearing at market interest rates. The Group currently does not have an interest rate hedging policy. However, the management monitors interest rate exposure and will consider hedging significant interest rate exposure should the need arise.

Total interest revenue/income from financial assets that are measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI is as follows:

|                                                         | 2022<br>HK\$'000 | 2021<br>HK\$'000 |

For the year ended 31 December 2022

### **37. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

### **Interest rate risk (continued)**

The Group's sensitivity to interest rate risk has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for bank balances at the end of the reporting period and the reasonably possible change taking place at the beginning of each year and held constant throughout the year. If interest rates on bank balances had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2022 would decrease/increase by HK\$429,000 (2021: decrease/increase by HK\$959,000).

### **Foreign currency risk management**

Several subsidiaries of the Company have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which expose the Group to foreign currency risk. During the year under review, the Group had not experienced any significant exchange rate exposure to US\$ as HK\$ and US\$ exchange rate is pegged. Besides, the Group continuously monitors foreign exchange exposure of C\$ and RMB and will consider a formal foreign currency hedging policy for it should the needs arise. The Group currently does not have a formal foreign currency hedging policy for C\$, however, the management regularly monitors foreign exchange exposure of C\$ and will undertake appropriate hedging measures should significant exposure arise.

The carrying amounts of the group entities' foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities, at the reporting date, are as follows:

|      | Assets   |          | Liabilities |          |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
|      | 2022     | 2021     | 2022        | 2021     |

### **37. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

### **Foreign currency risk management (continued)**

#### *Foreign currency sensitivity*

The following table details the Group's sensitivity to 10% increase and decrease in HK\$ against the relevant foreign currencies. Under the pegged exchange rate system, the financial impact on exchange difference between HK\$ and US\$ will be immaterial as most US\$ denominated monetary assets are held by group entities having HK\$ as their functional currency, and therefore no sensitivity analysis has been prepared against US\$.

Sensitivity rate of 10% is used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The analysis represents the sensitivity of trade and other receivables, bank balances, trade and other payables and lease liabilities that are denominated in ARS, RMB and C\$, the Group's major foreign currency items. A positive number below indicates an increase in loss after tax whereas a negative number below indicates a decrease in loss after tax where Hong Kong dollars strengthen 10% against the relevant currencies. For a 10% (2021: 10%) weakening of Hong Kong dollars against the relevant currencies, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the loss after tax.

|                            | 2022     | 2021     |
|----------------------------|----------|----------|

| ARS impact                 |          |          |
| Decrease in loss after tax | –        | (133)    |
| C\$ impact                 |          |          |
| Increase in loss after tax | 2        | 1        |

| Increase in loss after tax | 1        | 1        |

In management's opinion, the sensitivity analysis reflects the exposure at the year end, but not the exposure during the year.

### **Other price risk**

The Group is exposed to price risk from investments in listed equity securities and listed debt securities. The management manages this exposure by maintaining a portfolio of investments with different risk profiles.

#### *Sensitivity analysis*

### *Financial assets at FVTPL*

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.

If equity prices had been 20% higher/lower, loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2022 would decrease/increase by HK\$797,000 (2021: loss after tax would decrease/increase by HK\$1,123,000) as a result of the change in fair value of financial assets at FVTPL.

### **Credit risk and impairment assessment**

Credit risk refers to the risk that the Group's counterparties default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group. The Group's credit risk exposures are primarily attributable to trade and other receivables, loan and interest receivables, cash and cash equivalents and debt instruments at FVTOCI. The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover its credit risks associated with its financial assets, except that the credit risks associated with certain loan and interest receivables are mitigated because they are secured by collaterals.

### **37. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

### **Credit risk and impairment assessment (continued)**

#### *Trade receivables*

At 31 December 2022, the Group had concentration of credit risk for its trade receivables as 100% (2021: 100%) of the amount was attributable to the Group's two trading customers in Canada (2021: nil) and one customer in Hong Kong (2021: one customer in Hong Kong) and they contributed to 86% (2021: 3%) of the Group's revenue. However, since the trade receivables are due from reputable oil distributors in Canada with good settlement history and a major electrical power company (2021: a major electrical power company) in Hong Kong of good creditability, the management considers that the Group's credit risk is low and ECL is minimal at 31 December 2022 and 2021.

#### *Other receivables and deposits*

For other receivables and deposits, the management assessed individually on the recoverability of other receivables and deposits based on the financial background, financial condition and historical settlement records of the debtors, and also quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportive forward-looking information. The management believes that there are no significant increase in credit risk of other receivables and deposits of HK\$10,713,000 (2021: HK\$946,000) since initial recognition and the Group performs impairment assessment based on 12m ECL. For the year ended 31 December 2022 and 2021, the Group assessed the ECL for these other receivables and deposits as insignificant and thus no loss allowance is recognised.

During the year ended 31 December 2021, the management considered that the counterparty of the deposits held for the petroleum exploration and production business in Argentina was in financial difficulty since initial recognition and thus the amount of HK\$1,680,000 was written-off.

#### *Loan and interest receivables*

At 31 December 2022, the carrying amount of loan and interest receivables was HK\$60,852,000 (2021: HK\$115,001,000). The Group had concentration of credit risk for its loan and interest receivables as 100% (2021: 100%) of the carrying amount at 31 December 2022 was due from four (2021: five) borrowers which amounted to HK\$60,852,000 (2021: HK\$115,001,000) at 31 December 2022, and the loan made to the largest borrower amounted to HK\$23,808,000 (2021: HK\$37,090,000) which accounted for 39% (2021: 32%) of the Group's loan portfolio (on a net of impairment allowance basis). The Group seeks to maintain strict control over its outstanding loan and interest receivables to minimise credit risk. The management has a credit policy in place and the exposures to the credit risk are monitored on an ongoing basis.

### **37. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

# **Credit risk and impairment assessment (continued)**

*Loan and interest receivables (continued)*

The recoverability of outstanding loan and interest receivables are determined by an evaluation of the financial background, financial condition and historical settlement records, including past due rates and default rates of the borrowers and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information (such as forecast of macroeconomic factors including GDP growth and unemployment rate with adjustment on different scenarios of economic environment prospect) that is available without undue cost or effort at the end of each reporting period. The borrowers are assigned with different risk grading under internal credit ratings to calculate the ECL, taking into consideration the estimates of expected cash shortfalls which are driven by estimates of possibility of default and the expected loss given default including taking into account the amount and timing of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collaterals (if any) less the costs of selling the collaterals. Owing to the great financial uncertainty triggered by the COVID epidemic, the Group has increased the expected loss rates in the current year as there is a high risk that a prolonged pandemic could lead to increased credit default rates. The collaterals pledged to the Group in relation to outstanding loans comprise properties and unlisted debt instruments issued by a listed company in Hong Kong with the estimated fair value of the collaterals are lower than the related loan balances individually.

At 31 December 2022, included in the Group's loan and interest receivables balance were debtors with aggregate gross carrying amount of HK\$69,590,000 (2021: HK\$92,344,000) which were past due as at the reporting date, of which (i) nil (2021: HK\$34,134,000) had been past due for less than 30 days; (ii) HK\$12,500,000 (2021: HK\$537,000) had been past due for more than 30 days but less than 90 days; and (iii) HK\$57,090,000 (2021: HK\$57,673,000) had been past due for 90 days or more. Details of the cumulative ECL provided are set out in Note 22.

#### *Debt instruments at FVTOCI*

At 31 December 2022, the carrying amount of debt instruments at FVTOCI was HK\$33,739,000 (2021: HK\$78,396,000). The Group had concentration of credit risk for its debt instruments at FVTOCI as 94% (2021: 78%) of the carrying amount at 31 December 2022 was due from four (2021: four) debt instruments at FVTOCI which amounted to HK\$31,557,000 (2021: HK\$61,519,000) at 31 December 2022.

During the year ended 31 December 2022, provision of ECL on debt instruments at FVTOCI amounting to HK\$11,081,000 (2021: HK\$49,247,000) was recognised in profit or loss with corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. At 31 December 2022, the cumulative impairment allowance for debt instruments at FVTOCI amounted to HK\$67,432,000 (2021: HK\$56,351,000).

### **37. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

# **Credit risk and impairment assessment (continued)** *Debt instruments at FVTOCI (continued)*

The Group's debt instruments at FVTOCI mainly comprise instruments that have, on an individual basis, a commensurate level of risk of default when comparing to its rate of return in terms of coupon interest given that the counterparty has a stable capacity to repay. The Group assesses the financial strengths and performance of the issuers in satisfying the repayment of principal and interest of the debt instruments as they fall due. The Group also closely monitors the changes in credit ratings of the issuers and follows their market news for taking immediate actions if there is an indication of a deterioration of the repayment ability of the issuers.

The Group determines individually whether the issuers of the debt instruments have been suffered from significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition by comparing the credit rating and other qualitative benchmarks that affect the credit quality of the issuers at initial recognition and at the end of the reporting period. At 31 December 2022, included in the Group's debt instruments of carrying amount of HK\$33,739,000 (2021: HK\$78,396,000), debt instruments of (i) nil (2021: HK\$15,675,000) were assessed under 12m ECL, due to low credit risk; (ii) HK\$31,558,000 (2021: HK\$57,640,000) were assessed under lifetime ECL (not credit impaired), due to significant deterioration in the internal credit rating and adverse change in the business of the issuer during the reporting period; and (iii) HK\$2,181,000 (2021: HK\$5,081,000) were assessed under lifetime ECL (credit impaired), as certain issuers are engaging in businesses that are unstable and are in significant financial difficulties.

The Group had engaged an independent professional valuer to perform ECL assessment on the debt instruments and the Company's management worked closely with the qualified external valuer to establish the appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. In making that evaluation, the Group assessed the ECL for debt instruments at FVTOCI by reference to the credit rating of the debt instruments estimated by the recognised rating agency (i.e. Moody's, Fitch), the macroeconomic factors affecting each issuer, and the probability of default and loss given default of each debt instrument. The Group also took into account forward-looking information that was reasonably and supportably available to the Group without undue cost or effort, including information such as GDP growth rate and unemployment rate.

#### **Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due. In managing liquidity risk, the Group monitors and maintains sufficient funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due, including shareholder distributions. It is applicable to normal market conditions as well as negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Group's reputation.

The following table details the Group's remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities based on the agreed repayment terms.

For non-derivative financial liabilities, the table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest in effect at the end of the reporting period.
