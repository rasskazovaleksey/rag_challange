#### **Item 1. Business.**

#### <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Overview**

Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011. The Trust serves as the general partner of Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") which was formed as a Virginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. Substantially, all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, our Operating Partnership. At December 31, 2022, the Company owned 99.05% of the Operating Partnership. The Company is a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial real estate investment company that owns, leases and operates income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers.

On August 22, 2022, the Company completed a merger transaction with Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. ("Cedar" or "CDR"). As a result of the merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cedar's common stock, which ceased to be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). Cedar's outstanding 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and 6.50% Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding and continue to trade on the NYSE. Each outstanding share of common stock of Cedar and outstanding common unit of the Cedar OP held by persons other than Cedar immediately prior to the merger were cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment of \$9.48 per share or unit. As a result Cedar became a subsidiary of the REIT.

For additional information on recent business developments, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.

Our corporate office is located at 2529 Virginia Beach Boulevard, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23452. Our telephone number is (757) 627-9088. Our registrar and stock transfer agent is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and may be contacted at 150 Royall Street, Suite 101, Canton, MA 02021 or their website, www.computershare.com.

#### **Portfolio**

Our portfolio contains retail properties in secondary and tertiary markets, with a particular emphasis on grocery-anchored retail centers. Our properties are in communities that have stable demographics and have historically exhibited favorable trends, such as strong population and income growth. We generally lease our properties to national and regional retailers that offer consumer goods and services and generate regular consumer traffic. We believe our tenants carry goods and offer services that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader U.S. economy and consumers' disposable income, generating more predictable property level cash flows.

The Company's portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions. As of December 31, 2022, we own a portfolio consisting of seventy-nine properties, including seventy-five retail shopping centers, totaling 8,172,527 leasable square feet which is 92.9% leased (our "operating portfolio"), and four undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 61 acres. The properties are geographically located in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast, which markets represented approximately 44%, 41% and 15%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of December 31, 2022.

No tenant represents greater than approximately 10% of the Company's annualized base rent or 10% of gross leasable square footage. The top 10 tenants account for 23.19% or \$16.99 million of annualized base rent and 27.22% or 2.22 million of gross leasable square footage at December 31, 2022.

### *Our Team and Talent*

As of December 31, 2022, we have 47 full-time employees. We seek to hire experienced leaders and team members and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. Employees are offered flexibility to meet personal and family needs, which was further expanded when the COVID-19 pandemic began. In addition to medical insurance support, the Company offers wellness programs including free short and long term disability insurance, free basic life insurance policy with accidental death and dismemberment coverage, employee assistance programs that include emotional health support, gym memberships, volunteer time off and tuition assistance. Tuition assistance includes assistance to learn a new language as the Company identifies opportunities to better serve a diverse tenant base.

#### **Business Objectives and Investment Strategy**

Our primary business objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. We intend to achieve this objective utilizing the following investment strategies:

- *• Focus on necessity-based retail*. Own and operate retail properties that serve the essential day-to-day shopping needs of the surrounding communities. These necessity-based centers attract high levels of daily traffic resulting in cross-selling of goods and services from our tenants. The majority of our tenants provide non-cyclical consumer goods and services that are less impacted by fluctuations in the economy. We believe these centers that provide essential goods and services such as groceries and electric vehicle charging stations result in a stable, lower-risk portfolio of retail investment properties.
- *• Focus on secondary and tertiary markets with strong demographics and demand*. Our properties are in markets that have strong demographics such as population density, population growth, stable tenant sales trends and growth in household income. We seek to identify new tenants and renew leases with existing tenants in these locations that support the need for necessity-based retail and limited new supply.
- *• Increase operating income through leasing strategies and expense management*. We employ intensive lease management strategies to optimize occupancy. Management has extensive expertise in acquiring and managing under-performing properties and increasing operating income through more effective leasing strategies and expense management. Our leases generally require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of the expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, and managing the shopping center and the common areas, along with the associated insurance costs and real estate taxes. In many cases the tenant is either fully or partially responsible for all maintenance of the property, thereby limiting our financial exposure towards maintaining the center and increasing our net income. We refer to this arrangement as a "triple net lease."
- *• Selectively utilize our capital to improve retail properties.* We intend to make capital investments where the return on such capital is accretive to our stockholders. We allocate capital to value-added improvements of retail properties to increase rents, extend long-term leases with anchor tenants and increase occupancy. We selectively allocate capital to revenue enhancing projects that we believe will improve the market position of a given property.

![](_page_6_Picture_10.jpeg)

{7}------------------------------------------------

- *Recycling and sensible management of capital structure.* We intend to sell non-income producing land parcels utilizing sales proceeds to deleverage the balance sheet. In 2022, we sold two properties for a total of \$10.51 million net proceeds which were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. Additional properties may be slated for disposition based upon management's periodic review of our portfolio, and approval by our Board of Directors.
- *Strategy for Integrating Cedar Assets.*Through integrations of both software and personnel, the increased scale will allow the Company to maximize efficiencies both at the property and corporate level. Focusing on our core model of necessity, service and convenience-based retailers, the assets obtained through the acquisition of Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (the "Cedar Assets") complement our existing portfolio, further diversifying our tenant credit profiles and micro-market risks.

#### **Governmental Regulations Affecting Our Properties**

We and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health, safety, tax and similar laws. The application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of property-specific circumstances, including the current and former uses of the property, the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property. Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe they will in the future. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. We have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance that covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties.

#### **Competition**

Numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing of properties. Some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do, although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market. This competition may interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents and adversely affect our ability to minimize operating expenses.

Retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, superstores, and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services, such as direct mail. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.

### **Climate**

Some of our properties could be subject to potential natural or other disasters. In addition, we may acquire properties that are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and droughts. Properties could also be affected by increases in the frequency or severity of tornadoes, hurricanes or other storms, whether such increases are caused by global climate changes or other factors. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operating costs, increase future property insurance costs, and/or negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. If insurance is unavailable to us, or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from such events, our earnings, liquidity and/or capital resources could be adversely affected. While several of our properties are located in areas that have experienced hurricanes, tornados, severe rain storms, or snow during the past two years, there has been no substantial damage or change in operations related to weather events.

### **Information Technology and Cyber Security**

The Company depends on the proper functioning, availability and security of its information systems, including financial, data processing, communications and operating systems. Several information systems are software applications provided by third parties. Our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic security breaches. Such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats.

{8}------------------------------------------------

While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack. A cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations.

The Company has incorporated cybersecurity coverage in its insurance policies; however, there is no assurance that the insurance the Company maintains will cover all cybersecurity breaches or that policy limits will be sufficient to cover all related losses. The Company is not aware of any information security breaches over the last two years.

### **Insurance**

The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in its portfolio under an insurance policy, in addition to other coverages, such as trademark and pollution coverage that may be appropriate for certain of its properties. Additionally, the Company carries a directors', officers', entity and employment practices liability insurance policy that covers such claims made against the Company and its directors and officers. The Company believes the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for its properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses.

functions such as maintenance, landscaping, sweeping, plumbing and electrical are subcontracted out at each location and, to the extent permitted by their respective leases, the cost of these functions is passed on to the tenants.

We believe that focused property management, leasing and customer retention are essential to maximizing the sales per square foot, operating cash flow and value of our properties. Our primary goal in property management is to maintain an attractive shopping environment on a cost effective basis for our tenants.

The majority of our property management and leasing functions are supervised and administered by us. We maintain regular contact with our tenants and frequently visit each asset to ensure the proper implementation and execution of our market strategies. As part of our ongoing property management, we conduct regular physical property reviews to improve our properties, react to changing market conditions and ensure proper maintenance.

Our leasing representatives are experienced in the markets in which we operate; they are familiar with current tenants and potential local, regional, and national tenants that would complement our current tenant base. We study demographics, customer sales, merchandising mix and cultivate tenant relationships to optimize the sales performance of our centers and thereby increase rents. We believe this hands-on approach maximizes the value of our shopping centers.

#### *Market Information.*

Our Common Stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "WHLR."

### *Approximate Number of Holders of Our Common Stock*

As of March 2, 2023 there were 123 holders of record of our Common Stock. This number excludes stockholders whose stock is held in nominee or street name by brokers.

#### *Dividend Policy*

In March 2018, the Board of Directors suspended the payment of dividends on our Common Stock. The Board of Directors also suspended the quarterly dividends on shares of our Series A Preferred Stock ("Series A Preferred"), Series B Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred") and Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Series D Preferred"), beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2018. Dividends were suspended to retain cash flow to pay operating expenses and reduce debt.

As the Company has failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series D Preferred, the annual dividend rate on the Series D Preferred has increased to 10.75%; commencing on the first day after the first missed quarterly payment, January 1, 2019 and will continue until such time as the Company has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred in full. See Note 8, Equity and Mezzanine Equity, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

On November 3, 2021, common stockholders of the Company voted to amend the Company's charter (the "Charter") to remove the cumulative dividend rights of the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred.

{14}------------------------------------------------

As a result of the dividend suspension on the Series D Preferred, our Charter provides that no dividends may be declared or paid on the Common Stock or on our other outstanding preferred until all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred have been paid in full. At this time, the Company does not intend to pay dividends other than those required dividend distributions, if any, that will enable us to maintain our REIT status and to eliminate or minimize our obligation to pay income and excise taxes. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Future Liquidity Needs."

You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Form 10-K. For more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information, you should read the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

#### **Company Overview**

We are a Maryland corporation focused on owning, leasing and operating income producing grocery-anchored centers, neighborhood centers, community centers and free-standing retail properties. We have targeted properties located within developed areas, commonly referred to as in-fill, that are surrounded by communities that have strong demographics and dynamic, diversified economies that will continue to generate jobs and future demand for commercial real estate. Our primary target markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast.

Our portfolio is comprised of seventy-five retail shopping centers and four undeveloped land parcels. Twenty-one of these properties are located in South Carolina, twelve in Georgia, ten in Virginia, eight in Pennsylvania, six in North Carolina, four in Massachusetts, four in New Jersey, three in Florida, three in Connecticut, two in Kentucky, two in Tennessee, one in Alabama, one in Maryland, one in West Virginia, and one in Oklahoma. The Company's portfolio had total gross rentable space of approximately 8,173,000 square feet and a leased level of approximately 92.9% at December 31, 2022.

#### **Impact of COVID-19**

The spread of COVID-19 had a significant impact on the global economy, the U.S. economy, the economies of the local markets in which the Company's properties are located, and the broader financial markets. Local, state and federal authorities took preventative measures to alleviate the public health crisis primarily in 2020 and those preventative measures affected the operations of the Company's tenant base to varying degrees depending on the category and location of the tenant. While substantially all of the limitations and restrictions imposed during the onset of the pandemic have been lifted and/or eased and people have largely resumed pre-pandemic activities, economic conditions continue to negatively impact the financial health of certain retail stores.

The COVID-19 pandemic or variants or future outbreaks of other highly infectious diseases could impact the Company's ability to collect rent and could lead to increases in rent relief requests from tenants, termination of leases by tenants, tenant bankruptcies, decreases in demand for retail space at the Company's properties, difficulties in accessing capital, impairment of the Company's long-lived assets and other impacts that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to stockholders.

#### **Recent Trends and Activities**

There have been several significant events in 2022 that have impacted our Company. These events are summarized below.

#### *Acquisition of Cedar Realty Trust*

On August 22, 2022 (the "Cedar Closing Date"), the Company consummated transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 2, 2022 (as amended, the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the

![](_page_14_Picture_14.jpeg)

{15}------------------------------------------------

Company, WHLR Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub I"), WHLR OP Merger Sub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub I ("Merger Sub II"), Cedar, and Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P., the operating partnership of Cedar ("Cedar OP"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the Cedar Closing Date, Merger Sub II merged with and into Cedar OP, with Cedar OP being the surviving limited partnership resulting from such merger, and immediately following such merger, Merger Sub I merged with and into Cedar, with Cedar being the surviving company resulting from such merger (together, the "Cedar Acquisition").

Each outstanding share of common stock of Cedar and outstanding common unit of Cedar OP held by persons other than Cedar immediately prior to the merger were cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment of \$9.48 per share or unit. As a result of the Cedar Acquisition, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cedar's common stock, which ceased to be publicly traded on the NYSE. Cedar's 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and 6.50% Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding and continue to trade on the NYSE. As a result, Cedar became a subsidiary of the REIT.

In connection with the consummation of the Cedar Acquisition, the Company entered into a Guaranty of the obligations of Cedar OP under a Loan Agreement (the "KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement") by and between the Borrower, KeyBanc Capital Markets, as Lead Arranger and Bookrunner, and KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent and as lender, and under the other loan documents executed in connection with the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement.

By virtue of the Cedar Acquisition, the Company acquired 19 shopping centers (the majority of which are grocery-anchored), consisting of approximately 2.9 million square feet of gross leasable area and increased the Company's presence in the Northeast.

The consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K (the "Form 10-K") include Cedar starting from the date of acquisition. We have determined that this acquisition is not a variable interest entity, as defined under the consolidation topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB"), Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, and we evaluated such entity under the voting model and concluded we should consolidate the entity. Under the voting model, we consolidate the entity if we determine that we, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting rights and that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights.

#### *KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement*

On August 22, 2022, Cedar entered into the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement for \$130.00 million with interest-only payments due monthly through maturity, August 22, 2023. The interest rate on this term loan consisted of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 0.10% plus an applicable margin of 2.5% through February 2023, at which time increases to 4.0% and was collateralized by 19 properties.

The obligations under the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement were satisfied in full with the proceeds of the loans under the Guggenheim-Cedar Loan Agreement (as defined below) entered into on October 28, 2022 and the Patuxent Crossing/Coliseum Marketplace Loan Agreement (as defined below) entered into on December 21, 2022.

#### *Exchange Of er and Consent Solicitation*

On November 22, 2022, the Company commenced an exchange offer for its outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (the "Exchange Offer"). As subsequently amended, the terms of the Exchange Offer provided for the exchange of up to 2,112,103 outstanding shares of Series D Preferred, representing 67% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred, for (i) 6.00% Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2028, and (ii) Common Stock, in each case to have been newly issued by the Company, and related consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from the holders of the Series D Preferred (the "Series D Preferred Holders")to certain amendments to the Company's charter that would have modified the terms of the Series D Preferred (the "Proposed Amendments").

The consummation of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation was subject to, and was conditional upon, the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the condition that the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (i) validly tender their Series D Preferred into the Exchange Offer, and do not validly withdraw such Series D Preferred, on or prior to the expiration date of the Exchange Offer, and (ii) consent to the Proposed Amendments.

{16}------------------------------------------------

As of the expiration of the Exchange Offer on January 20, 2023,864,391 shares of Series D Preferred (representing 26.8% of the total outstanding Series D Preferred) had been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Exchange Offer. Accordingly, the condition that the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (i) validly tender their Series D Preferred into the Exchange Offer, and not validly withdraw such Series D Preferred, and (ii) consent to the Proposed Amendments, had not been satisfied, and the Exchange Offer expired on January 20, 2023.

As a result, the Series D Preferred remains outstanding with no change to its terms.

#### *Assets Held for Sale and Dispositions*

At December 31, 2022, there were no assets held for sale. At December 31, 2021, assets held for sale included Walnut Hill Plaza, which was sold in 2022.

Impairment expenses on assets held for sale are a result of reducing the carrying value for the amount that exceeded the property's fair value less estimated selling costs. The valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 2 inputs. Impairment expense was \$760 thousand for the year ending December 31, 2022, resulting from reducing the carrying value of Harbor Pointe Land Parcel. Impairment expense was \$2.30 million for the year ending December 31, 2021, resulting from \$100 thousand on Walnut Hill Plaza and \$2.20 million on Columbia Fire Station reducing the carrying value for the amounts that exceeded the property's fair value less estimated selling costs.

The following properties were sold during the year ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

| Disposal Date    | Property          | Contract Price | Gain (loss)    | Net Proceeds |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| December 9, 2022 | Butler Square     | \$<br>9,250    | \$<br>2,619 \$ | 8,723        |
| January 11, 2022 | Walnut Hill Plaza | 1,986          | (15)           | 1,786        |

In conjunction with the Walnut Hill Plaza sale, the Company made a \$1.79 million principal paydown on the Walnut Hill Plaza loan and on February 17, 2022 the Company paid the remaining loan balance of \$1.34 million in full. On December 9, 2022, the Company made a \$5.64 million principal payment on the Butler Square loan in conjunction with the sale of the Butler Square property.

#### *Guggenheim Loan Agreement*

On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the "Guggenheim Loan Agreement") with Guggenheim Real Estate, LLC, for \$75.00 million at a fixed rate of 4.25% with interest-only payments due monthly. Commencing on August 10, 2027, until the maturity date of July 10, 2032, monthly principal and interest payments will be made based on a 30 year amortization schedule calculated based on the principal amount as of that time. The Guggenheim Loan Agreement is collateralized by twenty-two properties and loan proceeds were used to refinance eleven loans including paying \$1.46 million in defeasance.

#### *JANAF Loan Agreement*

On July 6, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the "JANAF Loan Agreement") with CITI Real Estate Funding Inc. for \$60.00 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.31% with interest-only payments due monthly through maturity, July 6, 2032. The JANAF Loan Agreement proceeds were used to refinance three loans including paying \$1.16 million in defeasance.

#### *Guggenheim-Cedar Loan Agreement*

On October 28, 2022, Cedar entered into a loan agreement (the "Guggenheim-Cedar Loan Agreement") with Guggenheim Real Estate, LLC, for \$110.00 million at a fixed rate of 5.25% with interest-only payments due monthly through November 2027. Wheeler REIT, L.P. provided a guarantee in connection with such loan. Commencing on December 10, 2027, until the maturity date of November 10, 2032, monthly principal and interest payments will be made based on a 30-year amortization schedule calculated based on the principal amount as of that time. The Guggenheim-Cedar Loan Agreement

{17}------------------------------------------------

proceeds were used to refinance a portion of Cedar's property portfolio that were previously collateralized by the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement.

#### *Patuxent Crossing/Coliseum Marketplace Loan Agreement*

On December 21, 2022, Cedar entered into a loan agreement (the "Patuxent Crossing/Coliseum Marketplace Loan Agreement") with CITI Real Estate Funding, Inc. for \$25.00 million at a fixed rate of 6.35% with interest-only payments due monthly through maturity, January 6, 2033. The Patuxent Crossing/Coliseum Marketplace Loan Agreement proceeds were used to satisfy the remaining obligations of the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement and, accordingly, the remaining collateral was released.

#### *Interest Payments on Convertible Notes*

The Company's 7.00% subordinated convertible notes due 2031 (the "Convertible Notes") bear interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing on December 31, 2021.

Interest payments on the Convertible Notes were made as follows (in thousands, except for share values):

| For the years ended December 31, | Series B Preferred<br>number of shares | Series D Preferred<br>number of shares |  | Convertible Note<br>Interest at 7% |  | Fair value adjustment |  | Paid-in-kind Interest<br>Expense |  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--|------------------------------------|--|-----------------------|--|----------------------------------|--|
| 2021                             | —                                      | 113,709 \$                             |  | 885 \$                             |  | 725 \$                |  | 1,610                            |  |
| 2022                             | 1,511,541                              | — \$                                   |  | 2,310 \$                           |  | 1,429 \$              |  | 3,739                            |  |

#### *Preferred Dividends*

At December 31, 2022, the Company had accumulated undeclared dividends of \$34.63 million to holders of shares of our Series D Preferred of which \$8.47 million is attributable to the year ended December 31, 2022.

#### **Critical Accounting Estimates**

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

{19}------------------------------------------------

The critical accounting estimates and policies summarized in this section are discussed in further detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition. The following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management's judgment about matters that have a significant level of uncertainty at the time the accounting estimates are made, and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results.

#### **Revenue Recognition**

Principal components of our total revenues include base and percentage rents and tenant reimbursements. The Company combines lease and nonlease components in lease contracts, which includes combining base rent and tenant reimbursement revenue. We accrue minimum (base) rent on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases which results in an unbilled rent asset or deferred rent liability being recorded on the balance sheet. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants' sales volumes (contingent or percentage rent) which we recognize when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements. Although we periodically review the valuation of the asset/liability resulting from the straight-line accounting treatment of our leases in light of any changes in lease terms, financial condition or other factors concerning our tenants, they are subject to uncertainty. These assessments are inherently sensitive as they are based on the judgment of management and information available at the time of evaluation.

#### **Rents and Other Tenant Receivables**

We record a tenant receivable for amounts due from tenants such as base rents, tenant reimbursements and other charges allowed under the lease terms. We periodically review tenant receivables for collectability and determine the need for an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and other accounts receivable based upon customer creditworthiness (including expected recovery of a claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy), historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. We consider a receivable past due once it becomes delinquent per the terms of the lease; our standard lease form considers a rent charge past due after five days. A past due receivable triggers certain events such as notices, fees and other allowable and required actions per the lease.

#### **Acquired Properties and Lease Intangibles**

We allocate the purchase price of the acquired properties to land, building and improvements, identifiable intangible assets and to the acquired liabilities based on their respective fair values. Identifiable intangibles include amounts allocated to acquired out-of-market leases, tenant relationships, the value of in-place leases and ground. We determine fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the property. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related expenses. Such amounts are based on estimates and forecasts which, by their nature, are highly subjective and may result in future changes in the event forecasts are not realized.

#### **Impairment of Long-Lived Assets**

We periodically review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable, with an evaluation performed at least annually. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property's cash flows, occupancy and fair market value. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted future operating income before depreciation and amortization, plus its residual value, is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates or multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The Company may decide to sell properties. Properties classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. When the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, an impairment expense is recognized. The Company estimates fair value, less estimated closing costs, based on

{20}------------------------------------------------

similar real estate sales transactions. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 2 and 3 inputs. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

#### **Derivative Financial Instruments**

The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants and convertible notes, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statement of operations. The assumptions used in these fair value estimates are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

### **Liquidity and Capital Resources**

At December 31, 2022, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled \$55.87 million compared to consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of \$40.42 million at December 31, 2021. Cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in thousands):

|                      | Years Ended December 31, |  |             |  | Year Over Year Change |             |  |  |  |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--|-------------|--|-----------------------|-------------|--|--|--|
|                      | 2022                     |  | 2021        |  | \$                    | %           |  |  |  |

| Investing activities | \$<br>(133,512) \$       |  | 5,101 \$    |  | (138,613)             | (2,717.37)% |  |  |  |
| Financing activities | \$<br>118,200 \$         |  | (24,491) \$ |  | 142,691               | 582.63 %    |  |  |  |

#### **Operating Activities**

Our cash flows from operating activities were \$30.76 million and \$17.04 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, representing an increase of 80.49% or \$13.72 million. Net cash provided by operating activities, before net changes in operating assets and liabilities, was \$19.71 million and \$16.54 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in non-same store net operating income ("NOI") of \$5.91 million, primarily a result of the Cedar Acquisition and an increase in same store NOI of \$1.23 million, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses.

### **Investing Activities**

Our cash flows used in investing activities were \$133.51 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash flows from investing activities of \$5.10 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of (2,717.37)% or \$138.61 million primarily due to costs related to the Cedar Acquisition described in Note 3 included in this Form 10-K and an increase in capital expenditures paid of \$2.10 million.

#### **Financing Activities**

Our cash flows from financing activities were \$118.20 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash flows used in financing activities of \$24.49 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, respectively, representing an increase of 582.63% or \$142.69 million due to the following:

- \$302.35 million increase in loan proceeds a result of the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement, Guggenheim-Cedar Loan Agreement, Guggenheim Loan Agreement, JANAF Loan Agreement and Patuxent Crossing/Coliseum Marketplace Loan Agreement, partially offset by the 2021 refinancing activity including the Wilmington Financing Agreement;
- \$8.34 million decrease as a result of 2021 preferred stock redemptions made in the Company's tender offers; partially offset by

{21}------------------------------------------------

- \$4.87 million increase in deferred financing costs primarily related to the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement, Guggenheim-Cedar Loan Agreement, Guggenheim Loan Agreement JANAF Loan Agreement and Patuxent Crossing/Coliseum Marketplace Loan Agreement, partially offset by 2021 refinancing activity including the Wilmington Financing Agreement;
- \$158.51 million increase in loan principal payments primarily a result of the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement payoff, eleven loans paid associated with the Guggenheim Loan Agreement, the three loans paid associated with the JANAF Loan Agreement and the 2022 Walnut Hill Plaza and Butler Square payoffs, partially offset by the 2021 Powerscourt Financing Agreement payoff, the 2021 refinancing activities and the loans paid down as a result of 2021 property sales;
- \$1.93 million increase in prepayment penalties related to defeasance associated with the Guggenheim Loan Agreement and JANAF Loan Agreement, partially offset by the Berkley/Sangaree/Tri-County loan payoff; and
- \$2.69 million increase in dividend and distributions paid on noncontrolling interests.

The Company continues to endeavor to manage its debt prudently with the objective of achieving a conservative capital structure and minimizing leverage within the Company. Our debt balances, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, consisted of the following (in thousands):

|                           | December 31,     |      |         |  |
|---------------------------|------------------|------|---------|--|
|                           | 2022             | 2021 |         |  |
| (1)<br>Fixed-rate notes   | \$<br>482,447 \$ |      | 344,177 |  |
| Adjustable-rate mortgages | —                |      | 2,085   |  |
| Total debt                | \$<br>482,447 \$ |      | 346,262 |  |

(1) Includes portion attributable to liabilities held for sale, see Note 3 included in this Form 10-K.

The weighted average interest rate and term of our fixed-rate debt including liabilities held for sale are 4.99% and 7.43 years, respectively, at December 31, 2022. We have no debt maturing during the year ending December 31, 2023. While we anticipate being able to refinance all the loans at reasonable market terms upon maturity, our inability to do so may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. See Note 5 included in this Form 10-K for additional mortgage indebtedness details.

### **Material Cash Requirements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments**

Our expected material cash requirements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and thereafter are comprised of (i) contractually obligated expenditures; (ii) other essential expenditures; and (iii) opportunistic expenditures.

The primary liquidity needs of the Company, in addition to the funding of our ongoing operations, at December 31, 2022 are \$2.34 million in principal and regularly scheduled payments due in the year ended December 31, 2023 as described in Note 5 on this Form 10-K.

In addition to liquidity required to fund debt payments we may incur some level of capital expenditures during the year for our existing properties that cannot be passed on to our tenants.

To meet these future liquidity needs, the Company:

- had \$28.49 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022;
- had \$27.37 million held in lender reserves for the purpose of tenant improvements, lease commissions, real estate taxes and insurance at December 31, 2022; and
- intends to use cash generated from operations during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Additionally, the Company plans to undertake measures to grow its operations and increase liquidity through delivering space currently leased but not yet occupied, backfilling vacant anchor spaces, replacing tenants who are in default of their lease terms, increasing future lease revenue through tenant improvements partially funded by restricted cash, disposition of assets and refinancing properties.

Our success in executing on our strategy will dictate our liquidity needs going forward. If we are unable to execute in these areas, our ability to grow may be limited without additional capital.

In addition, the Board of Directors suspended Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series D Preferred dividend payments beginning with the fourth quarter 2018 dividend. On November 3, 2021, common stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Company's Charter to remove the cumulative dividend of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred. The Company believes that these actions support the Company's liquidity needs and improve the Company's capital structure.

#### *Series D Preferred Stock*

After September 21, 2023 (the "Series D Redemption Date"), the Series D Preferred Holders will have the right to cause the Company to redeem their Series D Preferred at a price of \$25.00 per share plus the amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends. This redemption price is payable by the Company, at the Company's election, in cash or shares of our common stock, \$0.01 par value per share ("Common Stock"), or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock.

Since January 2019, Series D Preferred (of which there are approximately 3.15 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2022) has been accruing unpaid dividends at a rate of 10.75% *per annum* of the \$25.00 liquidation preference per share, or at \$2.6875 per share*per annum*.

As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding Series D Preferred had an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately \$78.81 million, with aggregate accrued and unpaid dividends in the amount of approximately \$34.63 million, for a total liquidation value of \$113.44 million. Assuming dividends continue to accrue and remain unpaid on the Series D Preferred, then on the Series D Redemption Date we estimate that the aggregate liquidation preference (based on the 3,152,392 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022) would be approximately \$78.81 million, with aggregate accrued and unpaid dividends in the amount of approximately \$40.99 million, for a total liquidation value of \$119.80 million.

As of December 31, 2022, the Series D Preferred is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, at the option of the Series D Preferred Holders, into previously unissued Common Stock at a conversion price of \$16.96 per share of Common Stock. Based upon the closing price of our Common Stock on February 28, 2023 of \$1.58 per share, we believe it unlikely that Series D Preferred Holders would convert their shares of Series D Preferred into Common Stock in advance of the Series D Redemption Date, and likely that they would instead choose to exercise their redemption rights after the Series D Redemption Date.

In an effort to address the risk of a significant reduction to the value of a Series D Preferred Holder's investment in Series D Preferred and Common Stock following the Series D Redemption Date, the Company launched a modified Dutch auction tender offer in December 2020 for up to \$19.00 million (subsequently reduced to \$6.00 million) of Series D Preferred, in which 1,467,162 shares were tendered and 387,097 shares were accepted for purchase for an aggregate cost of \$6.00 million. We subsequently launched a second modified Dutch auction tender offer in April 2021 for up to \$12.00 million of our Series D Preferred, in which 103,513 shares were tendered and accepted for purchase for an aggregate cost of \$1.86 million.

In July 2021, we raised additional capital for the Company through a rights offering pursuant to which the Common Stock holders purchased \$30.00 million in aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable at the Company's option in cash, Series B Preferred and/or Series D Preferred.

On December 31, 2021, the first interest payment date on the Convertible Notes, interest was paid in the form of Series D Preferred. For purposes of determining the value of the Series D Preferred paid as interest on the Convertible Notes, each share of Series D Preferred was deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volumeweighted average prices of the Series D Preferred for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the interest payment date, and (y) 0.55.

On June 30, 2022, interest on the Convertible Notes was paid in the form of Series B Preferred. For purposes of determining the value of the Series B Preferred paid as interest on the Convertible Notes, each share of Series B Preferred was deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-weighted average prices of the Series B Preferred for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the interest payment date, and (y) 0.55.

![](_page_22_Picture_10.jpeg)

{23}------------------------------------------------

On January 3, 2023 (the next succeeding Business Day after December 31, 2022), interest was paid on the Convertible Notes in the form of Series B Preferred. For purposes of determining the value of the Series B Preferred paid as interest on the Convertible Notes, each share of Series B Preferred was deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-weighted average prices of the Series B Preferred for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the interest payment date, and (y) 0.55.

The Convertible Notes could have the effect of causing, if interest is paid in the future in shares of Series D Preferred, substantial dilution of the Series D Preferred and reduction in the value of any Series D Preferred.

In an effort to address the risk associated with the significant and growing financial obligation tothe Series D Preferred Holders, and to provide the Series D Preferred Holders with an opportunity to receive value for their Series D Preferred prior to the Series D Redemption Date, on November 22, 2022, the Company commenced an Exchange Offer and related Consent Solicitation.

The consummation of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation was subject to, and was conditional upon, the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the condition that the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (i) validly tender their Series D Preferred into the Exchange Offer, and do not validly withdraw such Series D Preferred, on or prior to the expiration date of the Exchange Offer, and (ii) consent to the Proposed Amendments. As of the expiration of the Exchange Offer on January 20, 2023,864,391 shares of Series D Preferred (representing 26.8% of the total outstanding Series D Preferred) had been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Exchange Offer.Accordingly, the condition that the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred (i) validly tender their Series D Preferred into the Exchange Offer, and not validly withdraw such Series D Preferred, and (ii) consent to the Proposed Amendments, had not been satisfied, and the Exchange Offer expired on January 20, 2023. As a result, the Series D Preferred remains outstanding with no change to its terms, including its redemption rights.

We anticipate that, in the event of the Series D Preferred Holders' exercise of such redemption rights after the Series D Redemption Date, the Company will not have sufficient available cash to pay the aggregate redemption price. Accordingly, in such event, we will not be able to meet our redemption obligation without either liquidating assets or issuing significant additional amounts of Common Stock.

The Company does not believe it is in its interests to liquidate assets or incur indebtedness to fund cash redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock and, accordingly, it has no intention of doing so. Therefore, the Company will likely be required to settle redemptions of Series D Preferred following the Series D Redemption Date in Common Stock.

We believe that the issuance of Common Stock to either (i) fund cash redemptions or (ii) directly settle redemptions in Common Stock, will result in a substantial dilution of Common Stock.

#### *Inflation, Deflation and Economic Condition Considerations*

Prior to 2021, inflation was relatively low and did not have a significant detrimental impact on the Company's results of operations. However, inflation substantially increased in 2022. In addition, substantially all of the Company's tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions include clauses that require tenants to reimburse the Company for inflation-sensitive costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and many of the operating expenses it incurs. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. Significant inflation rate increases over a prolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income.

Interest rate increases could result in higher incremental borrowing costs for the Company and our tenants. The duration of our indebtedness and our relatively low exposure to floating rate debt have mitigated the direct impact of inflation and interest rate increases, the degree and pace of these changes have had and may continue to have impacts on our business.

#### *Recent Accounting Pronouncements*

#### **Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021**

#### **Results of Operations**

Results from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflect the results of the Company's acquisition of Cedar on August 22, 2022. Accordingly, our results of operations will reflect the combined operations for the entire period for future quarters. Therefore, our historical financial statements may not be indicative of future operating results.

The following table presents a comparison of the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (in thousands, except Property Data).

for the years ended December 31, 2022, respectively, relating to legal settlement costs. Other income and other expense are non-operating in nature.

#### *Same Store and Non-same Store Operating Income*

NOI is a widely-used non-GAAP financial measure for REITs. The Company believes that NOI is a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company defines NOI as property revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or capital expenditures and leasing costs, impairment charges, it provides a performance measure, that when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. The Company uses NOI to evaluate its operating performance since NOI allows the Company to evaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and returns. NOI should not be viewed as a measure of the Company's overall financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, involuntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, market lease amortization, gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets, and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company's properties. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, the Company's NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs.

The following table is a reconciliation of same and non-same store NOI from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of net income (loss). Same stores consist of those properties owned during all periods presented in their entirety, non-same stores consist of those properties acquired or disposed of during the periods presented. The non-same store category consists of the following properties:

• Continuing operations

- Berkley Shopping Center and Berkley Land Parcel (sold March 25, 2021);
- Tulls Creek Land Parcel (sold July 9, 2021);
- Rivergate Shopping Center Out Parcel (sold August 31, 2021);
- Columbia Fire Station (sold November 17, 2021);
- Walnut Hill Plaza (sold January 11, 2022);
- Butler Square (sold December 9, 2022); and
- Cedar Portfolio, 19 properties (acquired August 22, 2022).

### *Property Revenues*

Total same store property revenues were \$62.15 million and \$59.59 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing an increase of 4.29%. The same store property revenue increases are primarily related to the occupancy growth since December 31, 2020.

#### *Property Expenses*

Total same store property expenses were \$20.28 million and \$18.96 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of 6.98% .Same store property expense increase was primarily due to expense increases in insurance, grounds and landscaping and repairs and maintenance.

#### *Property Net Operating Income*

Total property net operating income were \$48.81 million and \$41.67 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a increase of 17.14%, primarily as a result of the Cedar Acquisition.

#### *Funds from Operations (FFO)*

We use FFO, a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations and liquidity. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and December 2018). As defined by NAREIT, FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of loan origination costs), impairment of real estate related long-lived assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods, or as compared to different companies. Management uses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary measure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate

{28}------------------------------------------------

assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while historically real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a valuable alternative measurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating results.

Below is a comparison of same and non-same store FFO, which is a non-GAAP measurement, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

During the year ended December 31, 2022, same store FFO increased \$2.80 million.

We believe the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash amortization on loans and acquisition costs. Therefore, in addition to FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO ("AFFO"), which we define to exclude such items. Management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in determining AFFO as they are not indicative of the operating performance of our assets. In addition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, there can be no assurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs.

Total AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is shown in the table below (in thousands):

Other nonrecurring expenses of \$352 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021 include \$185 thousand in legal settlement costs, \$687 thousand in loan prepayment penalty on sale of the Berkley Shopping Center, partially offset with \$552 thousand in PPP Promissory Note forgiveness.

#### The preferred stock redemption of \$0 and \$70 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and

2021, respectively, represents the undeclared dividends on the stock retirement for the months preceding their retirement. Net changes in fair value of derivative liabilities is the result of the non-cash loss or gain from adjusting the warrant liabilities and embedded derivative liabilities to their fair market value, further details are described at Note 6 on this Form 10-K.

#### <span id="page-29-3"></span>**Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.**

#### *Disclosure Controls and Procedures*

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us inour filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

#### *Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting*

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

![](_page_29_Picture_15.jpeg)

{30}------------------------------------------------

- pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
- provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our Board of Directors; and
- provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Our internal control over financial reporting is evaluated on a regular basis by personnel in our organization. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary, as disclosure and internal controls are intended to be dynamic systems that change (including improvements and corrections) as conditions warrant.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, utilizing the framework established in "INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 were effective.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management's report in this Annual Report.

### *Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting*

On August 22, 2022, the Company completed the Cedar Acquisition and accordingly the Company's management has integrated Cedar's operations into its internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes related to the Cedar Acquisition. None of these integration activities had a material impact on our system of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2022

#### **Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries Virginia Beach, Virginia

#### **Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

#### **Basis for Opinion**

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

#### **Critical Audit Matters**

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

### **Evaluation of Investment Properties for Impairment**

### *Description of Matter*

At December 31, 2022, the Company's investment properties totaled \$561.0 million. As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its investment properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. Management evaluates various qualitative factors in determining whether or not events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment property may not be recoverable.

{34}------------------------------------------------

Auditing the Company's impairment assessment involved subjectivity due to the estimation required to assess significant assumptions utilized in estimating the recoverability of the investment properties based on undiscounted operating income and residual values, such as assumptions related to renewal and renegotiations of current leases, estimates of new leases on vacant spaces, and estimates of operating costs.

#### *How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit*

To test the Company's evaluation of investment properties for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the analysis. We compared the recoverability calculated to the remaining net book value of the assets to ensure recoverability for the properties' remaining useful lives. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to relevant market information and other applicable sources. As part of our evaluation, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the undiscounted cash flows of the related investment property that would result from changes in the assumptions.

#### **Derivative Liabilities**

#### *Description of Matter*

At December 31, 2022, the Company had convertible notes with an outstanding principal balance of \$33.0 million and 1.6 million common stock warrants. Calculations and accounting for the notes payable and embedded conversion features as well as the warrants require management's judgments related to initial and subsequent recognition, use of a valuation model, and determination of the appropriate inputs used in the selected valuation model. As more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a multinomial lattice model valuation technique in measuring the fair value of the notes' conversion features and a Monte Carlo simulation technique in measuring the fair value of the warrants

Auditing management's valuations of the derivative liabilities was challenging due to the complexity of valuation model and the inputs that are highly sensitive to changes such as the common stock market price, volatility, risk free rates, and yields.

#### *How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit*

To test the accounting for the derivative liabilities resulting from the issuance of warrants and convertible notes, our audit procedures included, among others, inspection of the contracts, and testing completeness and accuracy of the data used as well as management's application of the relevant accounting guidance. We also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the Company's determination of the fair value of the convertible notes inclusive of the embedded features and warrants, including testing the appropriateness of the methodology and underlying inputs used and assessing the reasonableness of those inputs.

#### **Valuation of Purchase Price Allocation for Acquisition**

#### *Description of Matter*

As more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on August 22, 2022 the Company acquired Cedar Realty Trust, a 2.9 million square foot shopping center portfolio consisting of 19 properties for an aggregate of \$135.5 million of cash merger consideration and acquisition costs. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition which required the Company to assess the acquisition-date fair value of all tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities. The Company determines fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the properties.

Auditing management's estimated fair value of all acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities required the assistance of our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge as the fair value estimates required subjective auditor judgment to evaluate the audit evidence obtained.

{35}------------------------------------------------

### *How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit*

To test the accounting for the purchase price allocation, our audit procedures included, among others, inspection of the purchase and sale agreements, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the fair value determination. We evaluated management's application of the relevant accounting guidance and involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the Company's determination of fair value of the purchase price allocations, including testing the appropriateness of the methodology and underlying inputs used and assessing the reasonableness of those inputs.

/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

#### **1. Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation**

Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011. The Trust serves as the general partner of Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), which was formed as a Virginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. At December 31, 2022, the Company owned 99.05% of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2022, the Trust, through the Operating Partnership, owned and operated seventy-five centers and four undeveloped properties. Twenty-one of these properties are located in South Carolina, twelve in Georgia, ten in Virginia, eight in Pennsylvania, six in North Carolina,four in Massachusetts, four in New Jersey, three in Florida, three in Connecticut, two in Kentucky, two in Tennessee, one in Alabama, one in Maryland, one in West Virginia, and one in Oklahoma. The Company's portfolio had total gross rentable space of approximately8,173,000 square feet and a leased level of approximately 92.9% at December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the use of the word "Company", "we", "our" or "us" refers to the Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires. The Company includes the Trust, the Operating Partnership, the entities included in the REIT formation and the entities acquired since November 2012. The Company prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. All material balances and transactions between the consolidated entities of the Company have been eliminated.

The Company owns, leases and operates income producing grocery-anchored centers, neighborhood centers, community centers and free-standing retail properties with a strategy to acquire high quality retail properties that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company targets properties in communities that have stable demographics. The Company considers properties that are generally located in the most prominent shopping districts in their respective markets, ideally situated at major "Main and Main" intersections. The Company generally leases its properties to national and regional supermarket chains and selects retailers that offer necessity and value oriented services and items and generate regular consumer traffic. The Company's tenants carry goods and offer services that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader U.S. economy and consumers' disposable income, which it believes generates more predictable property-level cash flows.

The Trust through the Operating Partnership owns Wheeler Interests, LLC ("WI") and Wheeler Real Estate, LLC ("WRE") (collectively the "Operating Companies"). The Operating Companies are Taxable REIT Subsidiaries ("TRS") to accommodate serving the Non-REIT Properties since applicable REIT regulations consider the income derived from these services to be "bad" income subject to taxation. The regulations allow for costs incurred by the Company commensurate with the services performed for the Non-REIT Properties to be allocated to a TRS.

#### *Acquisition of Cedar Realty Trust*

On March 2, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") with Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. ("Cedar"), Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P., ("Cedar OP"), WHLR Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and WHLR OP Merger Sub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub I ("Merger Sub II"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Cedar, including 19 of its shopping center assets, in an all-cash merger transaction consisting, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, of a payment to Cedar common shareholders of merger consideration of \$9.48 per common share (the "Cedar Acquisition").

On August 22, 2022, the Company completed the merger transaction with Cedar. As a result of the merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Cedar's common stock, which ceased to be publicly traded on the NYSE. Cedar's outstanding 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and 6.50% Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding and continue to trade on the NYSE. Each outstanding share of common stock of Cedar and outstanding common unit of the Cedar OP held by persons other than Cedar immediately prior to the merger were cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment of \$9.48 per share or unit. As a result Cedar became a subsidiary of the REIT.

During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company incurred acquisition related costs of \$5.51 million for the merger. These costs were capitalized as part of the acquisition and are primarily comprised of professional fees and legal fees, see Note 3 included in this Form 10-K for further details.

The consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K include Cedar starting from the date of acquisition. We have determined that this acquisition is not a variable interest entity, as defined under the consolidation topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB"), Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, and we evaluated such entity under the voting model and concluded we should consolidate the entity. Under the voting model, we consolidate the

entity if we determine that we, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting rights and that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights.

### **2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

#### *Investment Properties*

The Company records investment properties and related intangibles at fair value upon acquisition. Investment properties include both acquired and constructed assets. Improvements and major repairs and maintenance are capitalized when the repair and maintenance substantially extends the useful life, increases capacity or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

The Company allocates the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the asset based upon the fair value of each component which may be derived from various observable or unobservable inputs and assumptions. Also, the Company may utilize third party valuation specialists. These components typically include buildings, land and any intangible assets related to out-of-market leases, tenant relationships and in-place leases the Company determines to exist. The Company determines fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the property. Factors considered by management in the analysis of determining the as-if-vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods considering market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, tenant demand and other economic conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related expenses. Intangibles related to out-of-market leases, tenant relationships and in-place lease value are recorded at fair value as acquired lease intangibles and are amortized as an adjustment to rental revenue or amortization expense, as appropriate, over the remaining terms of the underlying leases.

The Company records depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally5 to 40 years. The Company reviews depreciable lives of investment properties periodically and makes adjustments to reflect a shorter economic life, when necessary. Tenant allowances, tenant inducements and tenant improvements are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.

Amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or related improvements. The Company amortizes amounts allocated to tenant improvements, in-place lease assets and other lease-related intangibles over the remaining life of the underlying leases. The Company also estimates the value of other acquired intangible assets, if any, and amortizes them over the remaining life of the underlying related intangibles.

The Company reviews investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property's cash flows, occupancy and fair market value. The Company measures any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted future operating income before depreciation and amortization, plus its residual value, is less than the carrying value of the property. Estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization include renewal and renegotiations of current leases, estimates of new leases on vacant spaces, estimates of operating costs and fluctuating market conditions. The renewal and renegotiations of leases in some cases must be approved by additional third parties outside the control of the Company and the tenant. If such renewed or renegotiated leases are approved at amounts below current estimates, then impairment adjustments may be necessary in the future. To the extent impairment has occurred, the Company charges to income the excess of the carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates, or multiples, leasing prospects for vacant spaces and local market information. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

*Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations*

![](_page_41_Picture_11.jpeg)

{42}------------------------------------------------

### **2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

The Company may decide to sell properties that are held for use. The Company records these properties as held for sale when management has committed to a plan to sell the assets, actively seeks a buyer for the assets, and the consummation of the sale is considered probable and is expected within one year. Properties classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. When the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, an impairment expense is recognized. The Company estimates fair value, less estimated closing costs, based on similar real estate sales transactions. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 2 and 3 inputs. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. See Note 3 for additional details on impairment of assets held for sale for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Assets held for sale are presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. This includes the net gain (or loss) upon disposal of property held for sale, the property's operating results, depreciation and interest expense.

#### *Conditional Asset Retirement Obligation*

A conditional asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement depends on a future event that may or may not be within the Company's control. Currently, the Company does not have any conditional asset retirement obligations. However, any such obligations identified in the future would result in the Company recording a liability if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Environmental studies conducted at the time the Company acquired its properties did not reveal any material environmental liabilities, and the Company is unaware of any subsequent environmental matters that would have created a material liability. The Company believes that its properties are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental, as well as non-environmental, statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company did not record any conditional asset retirement obligation liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

#### *Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash*

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of90 days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank operating accounts and money markets. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include its cash and cash equivalents and its trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with institutions of high credit quality.

Restricted cash represents amounts held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance, reserves for capital improvements, leasing costs and tenant security deposits.

The Company places its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on deposit with financial institutions in the United States, which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company ("FDIC") up to \$250 thousand. The Company's loss in the event of failure of these financial institutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC limit and the total amounts on deposit. Management monitors the financial institutions credit worthiness in conjunction with balances on deposit to minimize risk.

#### *Tenant Receivables*

Tenant receivables include base rents, tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to recording rents on a straight-line basis. The Company determines an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable based upon customer credit-worthiness (including expected recovery of a claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy), historical bad debt levels, and current economic trends. The Company considers a receivable past due once it becomes delinquent per the terms of the lease. The Company's standard lease form considers a rent charge past due after five days. A past due receivable triggers certain events such as notices, fees and other allowable and required actions per the lease.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables totaled \$3.15 million and \$633 thousand, respectively.

#### **2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

#### *Above and Below Market Lease Intangibles, net*

The Company determines the above and below market lease intangibles upon acquiring a property. Above and below market lease intangibles are amortized over the life of the respective leases. Amortization of above and below market lease intangibles is recorded as a component of rental revenues.

#### *Deferred Costs and Other Assets, net*

The Company's deferred costs and other assets consist primarily of leasing commissions, leases in place, capitalized legal and marketing costs, tenant relationships and ground lease sandwich interest intangibles associated with acquisitions. The Company's lease origination costs consist primarily of the portion of property acquisitions allocated to lease originations and commissions paid to third parties in connection with lease originations. The Company generally records amortization of lease origination costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Amortization of deferred costs and other assets represents a component of depreciation and amortization expense.

#### *Paycheck Protection Program*

The Company received proceeds of \$552 thousand (the "PPP funds") pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the "PPP") under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security ("CARES") Act.

The PPP funds were received in the form of a promissory note, dated April 24, 2020 (the "Promissory Note"), between the Company and KeyBank as the lender. Under the terms of the CARES Act, the Promissory Note was forgiven during the year ended December 31, 2021 and the corresponding forgiveness of the liability was recorded as "other income" on the consolidated statements of operations.

#### *Derivative Financial Instruments*

The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants and convertible notes, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The assumptions used in these fair value estimates are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. *Debt Issuance Costs*

The Company may incur debt issuance costs in connection with raising funds through debt. These costs may be paid in the form of cash, or equity (such as warrants and convertible notes). These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability in the consolidated balance sheets.

#### *Revenue Recognition*

#### **Lease Contract Revenue**

The Company hastwo classes of underlying assets relating to rental revenue activity, retail and office space. The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of these underlying assets and accounts for these leases as operating leases. The Company combines lease and nonlease components in lease contracts, which includes combining base rent and tenant reimbursement revenue.

The Company accrues minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases which results in an unbilled rent asset or deferred rent liability being recorded on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were \$6.52 million and \$5.77 million, respectively, in unbilled rent which is included in "rents and other tenant receivables, net."

{44}------------------------------------------------

### **2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

Additionally, certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants' sales volumes (contingent or percentage rent). Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements as variable lease income.

The Company's leases generally require the tenant to reimburse the Company for a substantial portion of its expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, insuring and managing the shopping center and common areas (collectively defined as Common Area Maintenance or "CAM" expenses). This significantly reduces the Company's exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation or other outside factors. These reimbursements are considered nonlease components which the Company combines with the lease component. The Company calculates the tenant's share of operating costs by multiplying the total amount of the operating costs by the tenant's pro-rata percentage of square footage to total square footage of the property. The Company also receives monthly payments for these reimbursements from substantially all its tenants throughout the year. The Company recognizes tenant reimbursements as variable lease income.

Additionally, the Company has tenants who pay real estate taxes directly to the taxing authority. The Company excludes these Company costs paid directly by the tenant to third parties on the Company's behalf from both variable revenue payments recognized and the associated property operating expenses. The Company does not evaluate whether certain sales taxes and other similar taxes are the Company's costs or tenants' costs. Instead, the Company accounts for these costs as tenant costs.

The Company recognizes lease termination fees, which are included in "other revenues" on the consolidated statements of operations, in the year that the lease is terminated and collection of the fee is reasonably assured. Upon early lease termination, the Company records losses related to unrecovered intangibles and other assets. The below table disaggregates the Company's revenue by type of service for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):

#### *Income Taxes*

The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations relating to REIT qualification. In order to maintain this REIT status, the regulations require the Company to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to stockholders and meet certain other asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates for the years in which it fails to qualify. If the Company loses its REIT status it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for five years unless the Company's failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied.

Management has evaluated the effect of the guidance provided by GAAP on*Accounting for Uncertainty of Income Taxes*and has determined that the Company had no uncertain income tax positions.

#### *Financial Instruments*

{45}------------------------------------------------

### **2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

The carrying amount of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities approximates fair market value due to their immediate or short-term maturity.

#### *Use of Estimates*

The Company has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Company's actual results could differ from these estimates.

#### *Corporate General and Administrative Expense*

Corporate general & administrative expenses consist of the following (in thousands):

|                                          |      |          | Years Ended December 31, |       |  |

|                                          |      |          |                          |       |  |

#### *Other Expense*

Other expense represents costs which are non-operating in nature. Other expenses were \$691 thousand and \$185 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, and consist of legal settlement costs.

#### *Lease Commitments*

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases, in which the Company is the lessee, are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU assets include any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company elects the practical expedient to combine lease and associated nonlease components. The lease components are the majority of its leasing arrangements and the Company accounts for the combined component as an operating lease. In the event the Company modifies existing ground leases or enters into new ground leases, such leases may be classified as finance leases.

#### *Noncontrolling Interests*

Noncontrolling interests is the portion of equity in the Operating Partnership not attributable to the Trust and noncontrolling interest attributable to the acquisition of Cedar. The ownership interests not held by the parent are considered noncontrolling interests. Accordingly, noncontrolling interests have been reported in equity on the consolidated balance sheets but separate from the Company's equity. On the consolidated statements of operations, the subsidiaries are reported at the consolidated amount, including both the amount attributable to the Company and noncontrolling interests. Consolidated

{46}------------------------------------------------

### **2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

statements of equity include beginning balances, activity for the period and ending balances for stockholders' equity, noncontrolling interests and total equity.

The noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership common unit holders is calculated by multiplying the noncontrolling interest ownership percentage at the balance sheet date by the Operating Partnership's net assets (total assets less total liabilities). The noncontrolling interest percentage is calculated at any point in time by dividing the number of units not owned by the Company by the total number of units outstanding. The noncontrolling interest ownership percentage will change as additional units are issued or as units are exchanged for the Company's \$0.01 par value per share common stock ("Common Stock"). In accordance with GAAP, any changes in the value from period to period are charged to additional paid-in capital.

The noncontrolling interest attributable to the acquisition of Cedar represents the fair value of Cedar's outstanding7.25% Series B Preferred Stock ("Cedar Series B Preferred") and 6.50% Series C Preferred Stock ("Cedar Series C Preferred") as of August 22, 2022, the date of acquisition. The valuation assumption was based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurements and represents Level 1 inputs. Level 1 inputs represent observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The total cumulative dividends for the Cedar Series B Preferred and Cedar Series C Preferred were \$3.91 million as of December 31, 2022 and are included as a reduction to net loss attributable to Wheeler REIT Common Stockholders on the consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2022.

#### *Recently Adopted Accounting Standards*

In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2020-06, "Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entities Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)." This ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating two of the three models in ASC 470-20 that require separating embedded conversion features from convertible instruments. In addition, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share and the treasury stock method will be no longer available. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. We adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2021 under the modified retrospective adoption approach. There was no effect to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of adoption. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be presented according to accounting standards in effect for those periods.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." This update enhances the methodology of measuring expected credit losses to include the use of forward-looking information to better calculate credit loss estimates. The guidance will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, such as accounts receivable and loans. The guidance will require that the Company estimate the lifetime expected credit loss with respect to these receivables and record allowances that, when deducted from the balance of the receivables, represent the net amounts expected to be collected. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim reporting periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, however the Company is early adopting as of January 1, 2022. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19 to clarify that operating lease receivables, including straight-line rent receivables, recorded by lessors are explicitly excluded from the scope of Topic 326. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

#### *Recent Accounting Pronouncements*

Other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies are not currently applicable to the Company or are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

|                               |                  |  |          |

The Company's depreciation expense on investment properties was \$13.49 million and \$11.07 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

A significant portion of the Company's land, buildings and improvements serve as collateral for its mortgage loans. Accordingly, restrictions exist as to the encumbered property's transferability, use and other common rights typically associated with property ownership.

### *Assets Held for Sale and Dispositions*

At December 31, 2022, there were no assets held for sale. At December 31, 2021, assets held for sale included Walnut Hill Plaza, which was sold in 2022.

Impairment expenses on assets held for sale are a result of reducing the carrying value for the amount that exceeded the property's fair value less estimated selling costs. The valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 2 inputs. Impairment expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in thousands):

|                           | Years Ended December 31, |        |  |       |

### *Cedar Acquisition*

On August 22, 2022, the Company acquired Cedar, a 2.9 million square foot shopping center portfolio consisting of 19 properties located primarily in the Northeast from Virginia to Massachusetts (the "Cedar Portfolio"). The Cedar Portfolio was acquired through the purchase of the issued and outstanding shares of Cedar's common stock, par value \$0.06 per share ("Cedar Common Stock"), and the issued and outstanding common units of Cedar OP held by persons other than Cedar for an aggregate of \$135.51 million of cash merger consideration and acquisition costs.

The following summarizes the consideration paid and the purchase allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in conjunction with the acquisition described above in accordance with ASU 2017-01, along with a description of the methods used to determine the purchase price allocation (in thousands, unaudited). In determining the purchase price allocation, the Company considered many factors including, but not limited to, cash flows, market capitalization rates, location, occupancy rates, appraisals, other acquisitions and management's knowledge of the current acquisition market for similar properties. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation based on the Company's initial valuation, including estimates and assumptions of the acquisition date fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in thousands):

### **6. Derivative Liabilities**

### *Fair Value of Warrants*

The Company utilized the Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the fair value of the Powerscourt Warrant and Wilmington Warrant (collectively, the "Warrant Agreements"). Significant observable and unobservable inputs include stock price, conversion price, risk-free rate, term, likelihood of an event of contractual conversion and expected volatility. The Monte Carlo simulation is a Level 3 valuation technique because it requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators. The Warrant Agreements contain terms and features that give rise to derivative liability classification. In determining the initial fair value of the Wilmington Warrant, the Company used the following inputs in its Monte Carlo model; exercise price of each of the three tranches described in the table below, Common Stock price \$3.75, contractual term to maturity 5.0 years, expected Common Stock volatility 54.72% and risk-free interest rate 0.91%.

Warrants to purchase shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

| Warrant Name                 | Warrants | Exercise Price | Expiration Date |
|------------------------------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Powerscort Warrant           | 496,415  | \$3.120        | 12/22/2023      |
| Wilmington Warrant Tranche A | 510,204  | \$3.430        | 3/12/2026       |
| Wilmington Warrant Tranche B | 424,242  | \$4.125        | 3/12/2026       |
| Wilmington Warrant Tranche C | 127,273  | \$6.875        | 3/12/2026       |

In measuring the warrant liability, the Company used the following inputs in its Monte Carlo Model:

|                                               | For the Years Ended December 31, |                 |

| Range of risk-free interest rate              | 4.14% - 4.68%                    | 0.72% - 1.16%   |

### *Fair Value of Conversion Features Related to Convertible Notes*

The Company identified certain embedded derivatives related to the conversion features of the Convertible Notes. In accordance with ASC 815-40,*Derivatives and Hedging Activities*, the embedded conversion options contained within the Convertible Notes were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through each reporting date. The Company utilized a multinomial lattice model to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives. Significant observable and unobservable inputs include, conversion price, stock price, dividend rate, expected volatility, risk-

Until September 21, 2023, the holders of the Series D Preferred are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 8.75% per annum of the \$25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of \$2.1875 per share) (the "Initial Rate"). Commencing September 21, 2023, the holders will be entitled to cumulative cash dividends at an annual dividend rate of the Initial Rate increased by 2% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14%. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on or before January 15 , April 15 , July 15 and October 15 of each year. On or after September 21, 2021, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Series D Preferred, for cash at a redemption price of \$25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the redemption date. The holder of the Series D Preferred may convert shares at any time into shares of the Company's Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of \$16.96 per share of Common Stock. After September 21, 2023, the holders of the Series D Preferred may, at their option, elect to cause the Company to redeem any or all of their shares at a redemption price of \$25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the redemption date, payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or any combination thereof, at the Company's option. th th th th

The Series D Preferred requires the Company maintain asset coverage of at least200%. If we fail to maintain asset coverage of at least200% calculated by determining the percentage value of (i) our total assets plus accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization minus our total liabilities and indebtedness as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") (exclusive of the book value of any Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock (defined below)) over (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, of outstanding shares of our Series D Preferred and any outstanding shares of term preferred stock or preferred stock providing for a fixed mandatory redemption date or maturity date (collectively referred to as "Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock") on the last business day of any calendar quarter ("Asset Coverage Ratio"), and such failure is not cured by the close of business on the date that is 30 calendar days following the filing date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, for that quarter, or the "Asset Coverage Cure Date," then we will be required to redeem, within 90 calendar days of the Asset Coverage Cure Date, shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock, which may include Series D Preferred, at least equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum number of shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock that will result in us having a coverage ratio of at least 200% and (ii) the maximum number of shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock that can be redeemed solely out of funds legally available for such redemption. In connection with any redemption for failure to maintain the Asset Coverage Ratio, we may, in our sole option, redeem any shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock we select, including on a non-pro rata basis. We may elect not to redeem any Series D Preferred to cure such failure as long as we cure our failure to meet the Asset Coverage Ratio by or on the Asset Coverage Cure Date. If shares of Series D Preferred are to be redeemed for failure to maintain the Asset Coverage Ratio, such shares will be redeemed solely in cash at a redemption price equal to \$25.00 per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, on such shares (whether or not declared) to and including the redemption date.

Dividends on the Series D Preferred cumulate from the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends have been paid. Dividends on the Series D Preferred cumulate whether or not (i) we have earnings, (ii) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and (iii) such dividends are authorized by our Board of Directors or declared by us. Dividends on the Series D Preferred do not bear interest. If the Company, fails to pay any dividend within three (3) business days after the payment date for such dividend, the thencurrent dividend rate increases following the payment date by an additional 2.0% of the \$25.00 stated liquidation preference per share, or \$0.50 per annum, until we pay the dividend, subject to our ability to cure the failure. On December 20, 2018, the Company suspended the Series D Preferred dividend. As such, the Series D Preferred shares began accumulating dividends at 10.75% beginning January 1, 2019 and will continue to accumulate dividends at this rate until all accumulated dividends have been paid.

Holders of shares of the Series D Preferred have no voting rights. Pursuant to the Company's Articles Supplementary, if dividends on the Series D Preferred are in arrears fosrix or more consecutive quarterly periods (a "Preferred Dividend Default") holders of shares of the Series D Preferred and the holders of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred upon which, like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (such the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred together, being the "Parity Preferred Stock"), shall be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors to serve on the Board of Directors (the "Series D Preferred Directors"). A Preferred Dividend Default occurred on April 15, 2020. The election of the Series D Preferred Directors will take place upon the written request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series D

Preferred and Parity Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is not permitted to fill the vacancies on the Board of Directors as a result of the failure of the holders of20% of the Series D Preferred and Parity Preferred Stock to deliver such written request for the election of the Series D Preferred Directors. The Series D Preferred Directors may serve on our Board of Directors, until all unpaid dividends on such Series D Preferred and Parity Preferred Stock, if any, have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment.

#### *Earnings per share*

Basic earnings per share for the Company's common stockholder is calculated by dividing income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding amounts attributable to preferred stockholders and the net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, by the Company's weighted-average shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, excluding amounts attributable to preferred stockholders and the net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, by the weighted-average number of common shares including any dilutive shares.

The following table summarizes the potential dilution of conversion of common units, Series B Preferred, Series D Preferred, warrants and Convertible Notes into the Company's Common Stock. These have been excluded from the Company's diluted earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would be antidilutive.

#### **10. Commitments and Contingencies**

#### *Insurance*

The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in its portfolio under an insurance policy, in addition to other coverages, such as trademark and pollution coverage that may be appropriate for certain of its properties. Additionally, the Company carries a directors', officers', entity and employment practices liability insurance policy that covers such claims made against the Company and its directors and officers. The Company believes the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for its properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses.

#### *Concentration of Credit Risk*

The Company is subject to risks incidental to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate. These risks include, among others, the risks normally associated with changes in the general economic climate, trends in the retail industry, creditworthiness of tenants, competition for tenants and customers, changes in tax laws, interest rates, the availability of financing and potential liability under environmental and other laws.

The Company's portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions and is geographically located in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Northeast, which markets represented approximately 44%, 41% and 15%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of December 31, 2022. The Company's geographic concentration may cause it to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. Additionally, the Company's retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants.

{63}------------------------------------------------

### **10. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)**

#### *Regulatory and Environmental*

As the owner of the buildings on our properties, the Company could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g., poor indoor air quality) in its buildings. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if the Company does not comply with such laws, it could face fines for such noncompliance. Also, the Company could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous materials or adverse conditions in its buildings, and the Company could incur material expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in its buildings. In addition, some of the Company's tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject the Company or its tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant's ability to make rental payments to the Company, and changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company's operations. The Company is not aware of any material contingent liabilities, regulatory matters or environmental matters that may exist.

#### *Litigation*

The Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business, including, but not limited to commercial disputes. The Company believes that such litigation, claims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or its results of operations. The Company records a liability when it considers the loss probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the below legal proceedings are in process.

*David Kelly v. Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.,*Circuit Court for the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Former CEO David Kelly filed suit on May 28, 2020, alleging breach of his employment contract. On March 15, 2022, the Court granted Mr. Kelly \$340 thousand with interest thereon at a rate of6% per annum from the date of termination, April 13, 2020, until paid, plus attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of \$311 thousand. On March 31, 2022, \$691 thousand was paid to Mr. Kelly. The Company has now fulfilled its obligations pursuant to the Court's Order in this case.

*JCP Investment Partnership LP, et al v. Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.,*United States District Court for the District of Maryland. On March 22, 2021, JCP Investment Partnership, LP, a Texas limited partnership and stockholder of the Company, JCP Investment Partners, LP, a Texas limited partnership and stockholder of the Company, JCP Investment Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and stockholder of the Company, and JCP Investment Management, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and stockholder of the Company (collectively, the "JCP Plaintiffs"), filed suit against the Company and certain current and former directors and former officers of the Company (the "Individual Defendants"). The complaint alleged that the Company amended provisions of its charter (as set forth in the Articles Supplementary in 2018) governing the issuance of the Company's Series D Preferred in violation of Maryland corporate law and without obtaining the consent of preferred stockholders and, therefore, the court should declare the Company's said amendment invalid, enjoin further purportedly unauthorized amendments, and either compel the Company to redeem the JCP Plaintiffs' stock or enter judgment for monetary damages the JCP Plaintiffs purportedly sustained based on the Company's alleged breach of its contractual duties to redeem the JCP Plaintiffs' Series D Preferred. The complaint also alleges certain violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and alleges that the Individual Defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The JCP Plaintiffs are each purportedly a holder of the Company's Series D Preferred. The complaint sought damages, interest, attorneys' fees, other costs and expenses, and such other relief as the court may deem just and equitable. The Company filed an answer to the complaint denying any liability. The Individual Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was denied. The JCP Plaintiffs filed a Motion For Partial Summary Judgment, as to which the Company and the Individual Defendants filed oppositions. The Judge denied the JCP Plaintiffs' Motion and ordered the parties to prepare a joint discovery schedule. The Judge also ordered the parties to engage in mediation with a Magistrate Judge. During the mediation process, the Company made no offers of settlement. On or about November 2, 2022, the JCP Plaintiffs entered into a Settlement Agreement resolving all their claims against the Individual Defendants, but to which the Company did not join. Thereafter, the JCP Plaintiffs advised the Company that they had decided to dismiss their claims against the Company, and the JCP Plaintiffs requested pursuant to applicable rule that the Company consent to the filing of a Stipulation of

*In Re: Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. Preferred Shareholder Litigation*, Case No.: 1:22-cv-1103, in the*United States District Court for the District of Maryland.*On April 8, 2022, several purported holders of preferred stock of Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. ("Cedar") filed a putative class action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland against Cedar, Cedar's former Board of Directors, and the Company arising out of transactions that included the then pending acquisition of Cedar by the Company. The defendants removed the case to federal court. *David Sydney, et. al. v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. et al.*in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Case No. 8:22-cv-01142. On May 6, 2022, a purported holder of preferred stock of Cedar filed a separate putative class action on the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Case No. 1:22-cv-01103 against Cedar and Cedar's former Board of Directors arising out of those same transactions. Following the denial of motions seeking to enjoin the acquisition of Cedar by the Company and other preliminary relief, the cases were consolidated under Case No.: 1-22-cv-1103. A consolidated amended complaint was filed on August 24, 2022 (the "Operative Complaint"). The Operative Complaint includes allegations of breach of contract against Cedar with respect to the Articles Supplementary governing the terms of Cedar's preferred stock and breach of fiduciary duty against the members of Cedar's former Board of Directors. The plaintiffs allege that Cedar breached their liquidation and conversion rights as set forth in Cedar's Articles Supplementary, and that the members of Cedar's former Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duty in structuring the transactions that include the merger. The Complaint further alleges that the Company tortiously interfered with Cedar's contract with the owners of Cedar's preferred stock and aided and abetted the alleged breach of fiduciary duty by Cedar's former Board of Directors. The Operative Complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount. The Company and Cedar have filed a motion to dismiss the Operative Complaint in its entirety which is fully briefed. The plaintiffs have recently filed a motion to certify an issue of law addressed in the motion to dismiss to Maryland's Supreme Court. That motion is not yet fully briefed.

### *Harbor Pointe Tax Increment Financing*

On September 1, 2011, the Grove Economic Development Authority issued the Grove Economic Development Authority Tax Increment Revenue Note, Taxable Series 2011 in the amount of \$2.42 million, bearing a variable interest rate of2.29%, not to exceed 14% and payable in 50 semi-annual installments. The proceeds of the bonds were to provide funding for

### **10. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)**

the construction of public infrastructure and other site improvements and to be repaid by incremental additional property taxes generated by development. Harbor Pointe Associates, LLC, then owned by an affiliate of former CEO, Jon Wheeler, entered into an Economic Development Agreement with the Grove Economic Development Authority for this infrastructure development and in the event the ad valorem taxes were insufficient to cover annual debt service, Harbor Pointe Associates, LLC would reimburse the Grove Economic Development Authority (the "Harbor Pointe Agreement"). In 2014, Harbor Pointe Associates, LLC was acquired by the Company.

The total debt service shortfall over the life of the bond is uncertain as it is based on ad valorem taxes, assessed property values, property tax rates, LIBOR and future potential development ranging until 2036. The Company's future total principal obligation under the Harbor Pointe Agreement will be no more than \$2.04 million, the principal amount of the bonds, as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the Company may have an interest obligation on the note based on the principal balance and LIBOR rates in effect at future payment dates. The Company funded approximately \$42 thousand and \$87 thousand, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in debt service shortfalls.No amounts have been accrued for this as of December 31, 2022 as a reasonable estimate of future debt service shortfalls cannot be determined based on variables noted above.

### *Tax Protection Agreement*

In 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Berkley, Sangaree and Tri-County, the Operating Partnership entered into a tax protection agreement that obligates the Operating Partnership to reimburse Jon Wheeler, the Company's former CEO, for his tax liabilities resulting from the recognition of certain taxable income or gain in the event the Operating Partnership takes certain action prior to November 10, 2023 with respect to Sangaree Plaza, Tri-County Plaza and Berkley. No liability was recorded as of December 31, 2022.

#### **11. Related Party Transactions**

The Company performs property management and leasing services for Cedar, a subsidiary of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Cedar paid the Company \$1.05 million for these services. Related party amounts due to the Company as of December 31, 2022 were \$7.33 million, which consists primarily of financing costs, real estate taxes and costs paid on Cedar's behalf at the closing of the KeyBank-Cedar Loan Agreement. These related party amounts have been eliminated for consolidation purposes.

### *Reimbursement of Proxy Solicitation Expenses*

The Company agreed to reimburse the Stilwell Value Partners VII, L.P., Stilwell Activist Fund, L.P., Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., Stilwell Value LLC and Joseph Stilwell (collectively, the "Stilwell Group"), for expenses it incurred in connection with the 2019 Stilwell Solicitation. At the 2019 annual meeting, our stockholders elected three nominees designated by the Stilwell Group to the Board of Directors. The Stilwell Group disclosed in the Stilwell Solicitation that it intended to seek reimbursement of the expenses it incurred in connection with such solicitation. This reimbursement was recorded on the consolidated statements of operations as "other expense". During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reimbursed the Stilwell Group \$369 thousand for these costs. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had reimbursed the Stilwell Group in full for these expenses.

#### **12. Subsequent Events**

### **Description of Securities**

#### **Registered Pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934**

As of December 31, 2022, Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. ("WHLR", the "Company" or "our") had five classes of securities: our common stock, par value \$0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), Series A Preferred Stock, no par value per share ("Series A Preferred"); Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value per share ("Series B Preferred"); Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value per share ("Series D Preferred") and 7.00% Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2031 (the "Notes"). Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series D Preferred are collectively referred to "Preferred Stock" hereinafter. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had authority to issue 215,000,000 shares of stock consisting of the following:

- 200,000,000 Common Stock authorized, 9,793,957 of which were issued and outstanding;
- 4,500 Series A Preferred authorized, 562 of which were issued and outstanding;
- 5,000,000 Series B Preferred authorized, 3,379,142 of which were issued and outstanding; and
- 6,000,000 Series D Preferred authorized, 3,152,392 of which were issued and outstanding.

Our Common Stock, Series B Preferred, Series D Preferred, and the Notes are registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act") on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange. The following is a summary of each class of our securities registered under the Act and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Charter"), Supplementary Articles, as amended and restated and our by-laws, as amended and restated (the "By-Laws"), copies of which are incorporated by reference within the Exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 of which this Exhibit 4.4 is a part. Our Series A Preferred stock is not registered on an exchange for trading and is not included in the following description.

### **Common Stock**

Pursuant to Article V of our Charter, each share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may reclassify any unissued shares of Common Stock from time to time in one or more classes or series of stock.

With respect to dividend payments and distribution of the Company's assets upon redemption and upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of shares of our Common Stock are subject to the prior rights of the holders of any shares of our Preferred Stock.

When and if declared by the Board, the holders of shares of Common Stock are subject to prior rights of the holders of any shares of our Preferred Stock for any dividends declared, paid upon or set aside for the Common Stock in any such year, dividends in cash, stock or otherwise. Any dividends on our Series D Preferred declared, but not paid shall be cumulative. No deposit, payment, dividend or distribution of any kind shall be made with respect to the Common Stock unless all dividends payable on the Preferred Stock have been paid.

### **Preferred Stock**

In the event of (i) any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Company or (ii) any sale or transfer by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior to and in preference of any distribution or payment upon the Common Stock, an amount per share of Preferred Stock equal to the sum of the Preferred Stock purchase price plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon. To the extent the assets and funds available for distribution after payment of all required obligations of the Company are insufficient to make such payment, then the entire assets and funds available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock. Any amounts remaining after payment in full of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Common Stock.

{78}------------------------------------------------

### **Series B Preferred**

Holders of Series B Preferred shares have the right to receive, only when and as authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Corporation, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cash dividends, at a rate of 9% per annum of the \$25 liquidation preference per share. The Series B Preferred has no redemption rights. However, the Series B Preferred is subject to a mandatory conversion once the 20-trading day volume-weighted average closing price of our Common Stock, \$0.01 par value per share, exceeds \$58 per share; once this weighted average closing price is met, each share of our Series B Preferred will automatically convert into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price equal to \$40.00 per share. In addition, holders of our Series B Preferred also have the option, at any time, to convert shares of our Series B Preferred into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of \$40.00 per share of Common Stock. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the holders of shares of our Series B Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of our assets a liquidation preference of \$25.00 per share. The Series Preferred B has no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless subject to a mandatory or voluntary conversion as described above. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock have no voting rights except as provided by law.

#### **Series D Preferred**

The Series D Preferred has a \$25.00 liquidation preference per share. Until September 21, 2023, the holders of the Series D Preferred are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 8.75% per annum of the \$25.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of \$2.1875 per share) (the "Initial Rate"). Commencing September 21, 2023, the holder's will be entitled to cumulative cash dividends at an annual dividend rate of the Initial Rate increased by 2% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14%. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on or before January 15th, April 15th, July 15th and October 15th of each year. On or after September 21, 2021, the Company, may at its option, redeem the Series D Preferred, for cash at a redemption price of \$25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the redemption date. The holder of the Series D Preferred may convert shares at any time into shares of the Company's Common Stock at an initial conversion rate of \$16.96 per share of Common Stock. On September 21, 2023, the holders of the Series D Preferred may, at their option, elect to cause the Company to redeem any or all of their shares at a redemption price of \$25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the redemption date, payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or any combination thereof, at the holder's option.

The Series D Preferred requires the Company maintain asset coverage of at least 200%. If we fail to maintain asset coverage of at least 200% calculated by determining the percentage value of (i) our total assets plus accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization minus our total liabilities and indebtedness as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") (exclusive of the book value of any Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock (defined below)) over (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, of outstanding shares of our Series D Preferred Stock and any outstanding shares of term preferred stock or preferred stock providing for a fixed mandatory redemption date or maturity date (collectively referred to as "Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock") on the last business day of any calendar quarter ("Asset Coverage Ratio"), and such failure is not cured by the close of business on the date that is 30 calendar days following the filing date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, for that quarter, or the "Asset Coverage Cure Date," then we will be required to redeem, within 90 calendar days of the Asset Coverage Cure Date, shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock, which may include Series D Preferred Stock, at least equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum number of shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock that will result in us having a coverage ratio of at least 200% and (ii) the maximum number of shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock that can be redeemed solely out of funds legally available for such redemption. In connection with any redemption for failure to maintain the Asset Coverage Ratio, we may, in our sole option, redeem any shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock we select, including on a non-pro rata basis. We may elect not to redeem any Series D Preferred Stock to cure such failure as long as we cure our failure to meet the Asset Coverage Ratio by or on the Asset Coverage Cure Date. If shares of Series D Preferred Stock are to be redeemed for failure to maintain the Asset Coverage Ratio, such shares

{79}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-79-0"></span>will be redeemed solely in cash at a redemption price equal to \$25.00 per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, on such shares (whether or not declared) to and including the redemption date.

Dividends on the Series D Preferred cumulate from the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends have been paid. Dividends on the Series D Preferred cumulate whether or not (i) we have earnings, (ii) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and (iii) such dividends are authorized by the Board or declared by us. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock do not bear interest. If the Company, fails to pay any dividend within three (3) business days after the payment date for such dividend, the then-current dividend rate increases following the payment date by an additional 2.0% of the \$25.00 stated liquidation preference per share, or \$0.50 per annum, until we pay the dividend, subject to our ability to cure the failure. On December 20, 2018, the Company suspended the Series D Preferred dividend. As such, the Series D Preferred shares began accumulating dividends at 10.75% beginning January 1, 2019 and will continue to accumulate dividends at this rate until all accumulated dividends have been paid.

Holders of shares of the Series D Preferred have no voting rights. However, if dividends on the Series D Preferred are in arrears for six or more consecutive quarterly periods, the number of directors on the Board will automatically be increased by two, and holders of shares of the Series D Preferred and the holders of shares of Parity Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting together as a single class) will be entitled to vote, at a special meeting called upon the written request of the holders of at least 20% of such stock or at our next annual meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of two additional directors to serve on the Board, until all unpaid dividends on such Series D Preferred and Parity Preferred Stock, if any, have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment. The Series D Preferred Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election. The Board of Directors is not permitted to fill the vacancies on the Board of Directors as a result of the failure of the holders of 20% of the Series D Preferred and Parity Preferred Stock to deliver such written request for the election of the Series D Preferred Directors. In addition, holders of shares of the Series D Preferred shall have the right to vote to approve any amendment to the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock. Any such amendment of the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.

### **7.00% Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2031**

This section includes a description of the material terms of the Notes and the indenture, dated as of August 13, 2021, among the Company, as Issuer, and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Trustee (the "Indenture"). Because this section is a summary, however, it does not describe every aspect of the Notes and the Indenture. The Indenture, and not this Exhibit, defines a holder's rights as a holder of the Notes. The Indenture has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 of which this Exhibit 4.4 is a part. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Indenture.

### General

On August 13, 2021, we issued \$30,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes under the Indenture and as of December 31, 2022, we had \$30,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes registered under Section 12 of the Act outstanding, as well as a further \$3,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued pursuant to an exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have listed the Notes on Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol "WHLRL". The Notes were issued under the Indenture.

The stated maturity of the Notes is December 31, 2031. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31 of each year starting on December 31, 2022 to holders of record at the close of business on the preceding June 1 and December 1, respectively. Interest will accrue on the Notes at a rate of 7.0% per annum. Interest will accrue on the Notes from and including the issuance date or from, and including, the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to, but excluding, the next interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months, until the principal thereof is paid or duly provided for. Interest on any overdue principal,

{80}------------------------------------------------

interest (to the extent lawful) or premium, if any, shall be payable on demand in the form as provided in Article Fourteen the Indenture. We issued the Notes in denominations of \$25. The holders of the Notes will not have the option to have the Notes repaid prior to the stated maturity date. Covenants

The Indenture contains standard covenants relating to, among other things, payment of principal and interest, maintaining an office where payments may be made or securities can be surrendered for payment and related matters, holding money for note payments in trust, maintenance of existence, maintenance of properties, payment of taxes, compliance with laws, notices to the trustee regarding certain matters and delivery of certain reports to the holders.

### Trustee

The Trustee for the Notes is Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, and we have initially appointed the Trustee as the paying agent, conversion agent and registrar with regard to the Notes. Except during the continuance of an event of default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture.

The Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or demand of the holders of the Notes, unless the holders of the Notes have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity that is satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities that the Trustee may incur to comply with the request or demand. Subject to applicable law and the Trustee's rights to indemnification, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

### Optional Redemption

After January 1, 2024, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or from time to time in part, at the Company's option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date (the "Redemption Price"). The Redemption Price may be paid: (a) in cash; (b) in shares of Common Stock; or (c) in any combination of (a) and (b). For purposes of determining the value of Common Stock paid as all or part of the Redemption Price, each share of Common Stock shall be deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-weighted average prices for the Common Stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the relevant redemption date and (y) 0.55.

### Conversion and Exchange

Upon a change of control, each Note will mandatorily convert into shares of the Common Stock equal to: (i) the principal amount of each Note divided by (ii) the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-weighted average prices for Common Stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the date of such change of control, and (y) 0.55. On the maturity date, in lieu of paying the principal of the Note in cash, the Company may elect to pay such principal: (a) in cash; (b) in shares of Common Stock; or (c) in any combination of (a) or (b). To the extent principal is paid in shares of Common Stock each share of Common Stock shall be deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-weighted average prices for Common Stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day preceding the maturity date and (y) 0.55.

The Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, at the option of the holders of the Notes, into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of \$6.25 per share of Common Stock (the "Conversion Price"); provided, however, that if at any time after September 21, 2023, holders of the Series D Preferred Stock have required the Company to redeem (payable in cash or stock) in the aggregate at least 100,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, then the Conversion Price will be adjusted to the lower of (i) 55% of the Conversion Price or (ii) a 45% discount to the lowest price at which any Series D Preferred Stock was converted into Common Stock.

{81}------------------------------------------------

### Ranking

The Notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company's obligations to the holders of senior indebtedness, and that in the case of any insolvency, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings or any liquidation or winding-up of or relating to the Company as a whole, whether voluntary or involuntary, all obligations to holders of senior indebtedness shall be entitled to be paid in full before any payment shall be made on account of the principal or interest on the Notes.

### Events of Default

The Indenture provides that an Event of Default means that one or more of the following events has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes:

- a. failure to pay the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note;
- b. failure to pay an installment of interest on any Note when due, if the failure continues for 30 days after the date when due;
- c. failure to timely provide notice with respect to any conversion or redemption of the Notes or failure to timely provide shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes
- d. failure to comply with any other term, covenant or agreement contained in the Notes or the Indenture, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after notice to the Company by the Trustee or to the Trustee and the Company by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable Notes then outstanding, in accordance with the Indenture;
- e. voluntary insolvency of the Company or any of its material subsidiaries;
- f. involuntary insolvency of the Company or any of its material subsidiaries if unstayed for at least 60 days.

If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Notes, except for the events of default relating to bankruptcy proceedings, either the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of, (and premium, if any) accrued and unpaid interest on, all the then outstanding Notes to be immediately due and payable in cash.

### Modification and Waiver

With the written consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes delivered to the Company and the Trustee , the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes for the purpose of adding any provisions hereto or thereto, changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions thereunder or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders thereunder and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by the Company or its affiliates; provided, however, that no such amendment, supplement or waiver shall, without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Note affected thereby (with respect to any Notes held by a nonconsenting holder):

- a. change the stated maturity of the principal of, or the payment date of any installment of interest on, or any additional amounts with respect to, any Note;
- b. reduce the principal amount of, or any premium or interest on, any Note;
- c. change the manner, consideration or currency of payment of principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Note;
- d. impair the right to institute a suit for the enforcement of any payment on, or with respect to, or of the conversion of, any Note;
- e. modify, in a manner adverse to the holders, the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Redemption Price or the Company's obligation to pay the Redemption Price when due;

{82}------------------------------------------------

- f. modify the ranking provisions of the Indenture, relative to other indebtedness of the Company in a manner adverse to the holders;
- g. reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes whose holders must consent to a modification or amendment of the Indenture or the Notes; h. reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes whose holders must consent to a waiver of compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes or a waiver of any Default or Event of Default; or
- i. modify the provisions of the Indenture with respect to modification and waiver (including waiver of a Default or Event of Default), except to increase the percentage required for modification or waiver or to provide for the consent of each affected holder.
