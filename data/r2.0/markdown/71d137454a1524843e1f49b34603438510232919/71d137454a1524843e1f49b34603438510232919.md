## HM Queen Elizabeth II 1926 – 2022

Polyflor was created in 1950. At the time it seemed to many as if Britain was losing its way in the post war world, but many more were optimistic. The newly formed NHS and the extension of the welfare state were part of what was to become the new Elizabethan age. Our company, and many others, were engaged in a seller's market exporting our goods, initially to the Commonwealth countries and then extending globally. HM Queen Elizabeth II travelled the world throughout the following years as our head of state. Her honesty, sincerity, sense of duty and service reflected back, in no small way, on the many businesses that exported from this relatively small nation.

### Trusted, reliable and constant.

I had the honour to meet the Queen when we were presented with the Queen's Award for Enterprise, as did others from our business as further awards followed. I can speak for all our employees from the shop floors of Manchester and Teesside, to our offices in Germany, Australia, France, Asia, Scandinavia, New Zealand, Canada, India and South America – you served us well your Majesty.

Thank you. May you Rest in Peace.

Geoffrey Halstead President

## Chairman's Statement

### Results

Revenue for the year at £291.9m (2021: £266.4m) is 9.6% ahead of the comparative year.

Underlying operating profit is £51.1 million (2021: £51.3m) – 0.4 % below last year. The reported profit for the year of £52.2m differed from this due to the one-off effect of insurance pay-outs in respect of the breakdown of one of the major production lines at our Radcliffe manufacturing plant in September 2019.

As I wrote in our trading update on 1 August 2022, the second half of the year has been, on the one hand, a period of full production for our factories in the UK but also with its challenges. The optimism at the start of the year on the decline of Covid-19, related supply problems and greater availability of labour was offset by a myriad of shortages/cost increases following the invasion of the Ukraine. Transport, fuel and energy increases were immediately obvious and whilst a significant issue during the spring/summer period, we have been mindful that the autumn/winter period may bring deeper problems. The most obvious effect on our business has been our decision to increase stockholdings as we sought to mitigate the risks associated with the potential inability to manufacture. This, in our view, seemed judicious and hopefully is over-cautious. In the event that the crisis does not escalate, then it is likely we will temporarily suspend some production for a period to bring stock levels back to normal.

Trading margins during the year decreased but are acceptable given the flood of cost increases that we have in part passed on. As I noted in the last two years' trading updates, this period was again not normal. For example, in some flooring projects that have been severely delayed, we have honoured the prices originally quoted to preserve the volume needed to feed our production lines. In other instances, we have re-priced to find volume still goes elsewhere and in many cases we have re-priced again and retained the business. This is the nature of our industry with over-capacity of supply and at least one global competitor has fallen into receivership on the back of facing similar issues. Whilst some other industries have priced daily on the back of this difficult situation, we have walked a more cautious path and I commend our teams that collectively have been successful in managing the challenges we face.

There have been some positives in the midst of a generally difficult trading environment. The general boycott in Russian trade has eased the widespread shortage of shipping containers that has prevailed since Covid-19 disrupted normal shipping routes. Similarly, with Russian bound supplies of certain raw materials facing export restrictions there was, at times, more availability to our factories as these were diverted back into the European market. Overall it was a difficult period for manufacturing.

### The company and our strategy

James Halstead is a group of companies involved in the manufacture and supply of flooring for commercial and domestic purposes, based in Bury UK. James Halstead plc has been listed on the London Stock Exchange for nearly 75 years.

The group was established in 1914 and continues to operate out of the original premises in Bury. In its factories in Bury and Teesside it manufactures resilient flooring for distribution in the UK and worldwide.

The company's strategy is to constantly develop its brand identity and its reputation for quality, product innovation, durability and availability, thereby enhancing and maintaining goodwill with the aim of achieving repeat business. Our focus is to work with stockists who in turn distribute those bulk deliveries whilst promoting and representing the products to the end users and specifiers who will purchase the stock from those stockists.

This approach is designed to increase and secure revenue streams and drive profitability and cash flow which enables the continuation of dividends thereby creating shareholder wealth. In the normal course of business one key element of the company ethos is having dedicated sales personnel to present our product to our customers' clientele.

Over many years our strategy has also included a policy of continual investment in both process improvement and in product development to improve output efficiency and product offering.

{5}------------------------------------------------

### Chairman's Statement continued

### Corporate governance and corporate social responsibility and the environment

The board has over many years recognised its responsibility towards good corporate governance. It is part of our character and, I believe, contributes to our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. Increasingly companies are, quite rightly, tasked with demonstrating that their environmental credentials and supply chain management are supported by social and sustainability dimensions with appropriate stewardship.

We can say, with some pride, that almost 100% of our electric usage is now derived from renewables. Our biannual Sustainability Report was published in 2021 and we have this report independently audited to further underline our credentials. (Available to download on our website).

PVC polymer is one of our main raw materials and we began recycling waste into our processes in the 1950s and have continued to use waste PVC as part of the process of manufacturing in ever increasing volumes. For many years we have funded waste collection with Recofloor – our UK joint venture that collects post installation waste PVC within our industry. We are also founder members of the European PVC recycling venture, the AgPr, which funds the recycling of post-consumer PVC waste and diverts waste from landfill back into the manufacturing process.

An important point to note about PVC is that it has evolved and it is no longer just derived from petrochemicals. It is increasingly produced from bio-mass. Indeed, many of the by-products of PVC manufacturing are indispensable to the medical and food industries. PVC manufacture has the lowest consumption of primary energy of any of the major commodity plastics and our PVC flooring is made with over 80% renewable materials. Our recycling initiatives further reduce our footprint on the environment.

As part of our focus on the future and the footprint of our industry we are major partners in industry wide bodies.We are, for example, active members of the ERFMI (the European Resilient Flooring Manufacturing Institute). ERFMI activities range from involvement in the EU carbon neutral strategy through to funding new recycling initiatives to extend the ability of PVC to be recovered and recycled.

The UK may have left the European Union but our work on standards, the circular economy, sustainability and meaningful recycling is both Europe wide and globally focused and is progressing at pace. In no way has "Brexit" lessened our involvement as Europeans in the flooring industry.

### Dividend

Our cash balances stand at £52.1 million (2021: £83.3 million) with the major reason for the reduction being, obviously, increased stock. The inventory at the year end is £112.3 million (2021: £60.7 million) which is about 85% higher than the prior year comparative.

Also of note regarding the cash flow for the year is taxation paid of £9.9 million (2021: £9.9 million) – unchanged and equity dividends paid of £32.3 million (2021: £34.1 million) – down 5.3%.

Having this large investment in our stockholdings and with the challenges facing our companies in terms of cash flow, the Board do not propose to increase the final dividend which will remain at the level of last year and will be paid in December 2022.

The interim dividend of 2.25p (2021: 4.25p) was paid in June 2022.

### Acknowledgements

As is customary, I would like to thank our staff for their continued efforts in achieving this year's result.

In addition, I feel I must note the death of HM Queen Elizabeth II. The brand 'Polyflor' was created in 1950, just prior to start of her reign. Her Majesty's service over the years since has no doubt been the rock on which the reputation of the United Kingdom has been built and helped in the growth of our exports over the last 70 years.

Our thanks also to the UK Contract Flooring Association for their members' accolades with Polyflor being awarded the 2022 Manufacturer of the Year, as well as the Healthcare Installation of the Year (Kitwood House Care Home in Cheshire) and International Installation of the Year (Live Sport Offices, Prague).

{6}------------------------------------------------

### Outlook

Trading from the year-end to date has been positive. Post year end, prices have been increased and demand has remained strong.

Sales volume is higher and we have continued to pass on cost increases. Costs, most particularly energy, have continued to rise. The fall in the value of sterling, most markedly against the US dollar, in recent days will no doubt have implications to certain input costs but equally, given our level of exports, will have some positives.

We cannot forecast the effects of energy costs on the myriad of materials and goods that are needed to undertake mass volume manufacture but with the vast array of skills, knowledge and entrepreneurs within our collective, each challenge should be overcome.

In the light of current demand, with the accumulated industry experience at our disposal, I, and the Board, remain confident of progress over the medium term, notwithstanding the short term challenges I have highlighted in my statement.

Anthony Wild Chairman

30 September 2022

{7}------------------------------------------------

## Chief Executive's Review

As noted by the Chairman, it has been a mixed year. For the largest input costs to our manufacturing we have had to accept price increases. Be it energy or raw materials it has been a constant adverse situation. The simple idea that these costs are passed on is complicated.

- (a) Complicated by the project related nature of quotations and the time from quotation to supply of the stock, reality of losing business at high prices or maintaining it at a loss.
- (b) Complicated by the fact that at least two generations that have never seen inflation of this scale and who are partly in denial as to its reality, duration and implications.
- (c) Complicated by the possibility that this may yet affect the continuous production we have enjoyed over many, many years.

These challenges are faced by many of our European competitors and inevitably there is a degree of margin erosion which manufacturers from all types of industry face.

Reviewing the businesses in more detail:

### Objectflor/Karndean and James Halstead France, our European operations

In Germany sales growth of near 12% came largely from cost surcharges and price increases as costs increased during the year. In one of the most competitive markets for flooring, volumes were maintained. The year was one of two halves with the earlier part facing stock shortages due to adverse shipping conditions. There were key product launches that were delayed by both the availability of complete stock ranges and difficulties in supply of marketing materials to support launches.The stock situation improved as the year progressed.

In France sales were increased by 18%, volumes also increased though by a lesser percentage. Investments in regional sales teams were key to the sales growth. Stock levels have grown, once again largely planned in the expectation of supply problems.

### Polyflor Pacific – encompassing Australia, New Zealand and Asia

In Australia, sales were some 6% ahead of the prior year with increases in profitability that resulted from increased margin due to favourable product mix and staff costs savings compared to the prior year. The staff savings were the result of difficulties in recruitment leaving vacancies for periods of time. The favourable product mix was due to higher margin domestic flooring sales having taken a larger proportion of sales than commercial flooring. This was, no doubt, in part because Covid-19 restrictions were in place for a long part of the first half financial year. Freight costs, as with all markets, were greater. Stock levels increased.

In New Zealand sales were lower than the comparative year. This market had the longest Covid restrictions of our major markets. Operational restrictions impacted the economy and the building sector in particular. Supplying New Zealand was challenging with shipments of flooring from the UK taking up to 8 months from order due to sea freight complexities such as shortages of shipping containers in Europe and severe congestion in ports such as Singapore. The supply of flooring into nationwide social housing contracts continues to be an important source of revenue and will continue as backlogs in the roll-out programme alleviate. One negative was the supply of cushion vinyl from European manufacturers which was severely disrupted. Nevertheless, it is pleasing to report increased market share and customer satisfaction – largely due to our company having stock and offering service levels far better than competitors. Stock levels have been increased.

This was the first full year of our Malaysian business (which also covers the South Eastern markets of Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines) and we can be satisfied with the progress made to date. The start of the year was again hampered by various lockdowns and travel movements across the territories, but as the year progressed, we saw the order book and sales grow, with sales across the region 153% ahead of last year.

The order book remains healthy, and we have every expectation that sales will continue to grow. At the end of the financial year, we strengthened the sales team further by employing salespeople directly in Vietnam and Thailand to support the distributors, and similar plans are in place for the Philippines before the end of 2022.

### Polyflor & Riverside Flooring, based in UK

We continue to see growth in the heterogeneous ranges manufactured at Teesside, and a falloff in certain of the 'older' ranges manufactured in Radcliffe. Overall volumes were maintained. Output was increased as we returned to a situation of being able to run all production lines, albeit with continued absenteeism levels that are above the "normal" levels that existed prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The increase in energy and raw material costs have put pressure on our margins and whilst we have a proportion of 

{8}------------------------------------------------

our energy consumption on forward contracts, costs continue to rise to unprecedented levels. The recent announcement by the government, whilst welcome, will only limit the increase, not reduce it. Availability of raw materials has improved, but costs remain high. The impact of rising energy costs on the production costs has been a significant issue.

We have made several price increases during the year across our ranges and across all markets to pass on these increases. This continues to be the case after the year end.

Stocks in the UK also increased, both in manufactured and merchanted goods. Delays in product launches earlier in the year compounded the issue as we waited for marketing material, such as shade cards and display boards. This was another fallout of the Ukraine war due to the lack of wood pulp and related materials.

### Polyflor Nordic comprising Polyflor Norway based in Oslo and Falck Design based in Sweden

The markets have been re-organised to bring both Norway and Sweden under one reporting structure. In Norway sales are 17% ahead of the prior year largely supported by price increases. Net profit rose by just under 6%. Heterogeneous flooring (supplied by Riverside) grew and there has been investment in additional staff in internal sales and regional sales areas. In Sweden, sales increased 37% and the volume of product supplied from our UK factories increased by near 50%. It must be noted that the prior year comparatives were subdued by Covid-19 but nevertheless this is a good result for both countries.

### Polyflor Canada, based in Toronto

A record year for sales and a significant increase in net profit against a generally sluggish economy. Our market share is still embryonic in this market but with the shadow of Covid-19 having crippled travel for much of the financial year this was a creditable performance. Our Canadian business is very largely project based and these have faced delays in funding and progress but the business is well placed for further growth.

### Rest of the World

Our products are sold in many markets across the globe and the preceding sections cover some of the key markets where we have a local presence and warehousing. These markets have been long established for the sales of our flooring and there has also been significant growth in several other markets when compared to last year. Spain was up 30%, South America up 48% and the Middle East up 59%. In some instances the comparative for 2021 was affected by the impact of the Covid-19 virus (most notably in Spain). It is pleasing to see these markets have recovered, this has been hard to achieve with the cost of international freight and equally as problematical have been delays and difficulties in available shipping. The markets that did not grow in the year were Africa and North Asia.

The North Asia markets have experienced a challenging year due to the increase in Covid-19 cases and the "zero-Covid" policy adopted across China. This meant our local warehouse in China, which became operational last year supplying smaller and local orders, as well as being able to support other Asian markets, could not despatch products. Several larger Asian projects, which are shipped direct, have been delayed. Latterly we have started to see some improvement but sales for 2022 fell by 28% against the previous year.

### In conclusion

Given the circumstances we can only be pleased with the results for the year. The hard work, dedication and experience of our subsidiary directors and management has been a key factor in this achievement.

However, the challenges have not lessened.

Mark Halstead Chief Executive

30 September 2022

{9}------------------------------------------------

## Financial Director's Review

As is usual, we have prepared these accounts by the consistent application of accounting standards with due appraisal and judicious accrual for known probable liabilities with as yet uncertain outcome at the year end. As in previous years we, as a board, look to be prudent.

The group operates through separate legal entities in certain areas of the world and though these are discussed in the Chief Executive's Review we, as a board, have concluded that these operations are one segment for the purposes of IFRS 8.

### Some key statistics:

- Group turnover at £291.9 million (2021: £266.4 million) was 9.6% higher than last year.
- Profit before tax was £52.1 million (2021: £51.3 million) 1.6% higher than last year.
- Selling and distribution costs were 8.6% higher than last year. Administration expenses were 19.2% lower than last year
- Trade debtors increased to £46.7 million (2021: £39.3 million). Trade creditors increased to £61.5 million (2021: £40.9 million).
- Stock levels stand at £112.3 million (2021: £60.7 million).
- Cash stands at £52.1 million (2021: £83.3 million) even after the payment of £32.3 million in dividends, £9.9 million in tax and £3.2 million of capital expenditure.

### Key performance indicators

The board considers growth in profit before tax and growth in dividend key targets in line with the task of delivering shareholder value. Control of working capital continues to be important and the level of cash is monitored. Cash flow has been a key performance measure.

Rather than focus on individual working capital targets or ratios, the board are informed of all significant issues directly by subsidiary management by means of monthly reports on the key decisions and influences on working capital. Our focus at subsidiary level is on stock availability and appropriate credit given to and received from customers and suppliers respectively. Obviously sales, margin and profitability are monitored as well as cash, which is the final result of our economic activities. Appropriate summaries of these statistics are collated into monthly group reports. These accounts contain analysis and more importantly we require each director to undertake a written report on their area and often these include key indicators (obvious examples are level of absenteeism in the factories, debtor days and margin by product line but these are backed up with detail of the key drivers of these ratios and the planned response).

No individual key performance indicator, or group thereof, is regarded as more important than informed, in-depth knowledge of the underlying businesses. Subsidiaries present key performance indicators on debtor days, stock turn and creditor days but the consolidation of these for the whole group offers no extra benefit as the component of mix can mask underlying effects. One such indicator that is under close scrutiny is absenteeism.

In terms of non-financial KPIs brand awareness, reputation, customer satisfaction and market share are all important but difficult to assess. We do not believe that surveys and market share data, to the extent that they are collated by various trade bodies, is complete and wholly accurate. Consequently little reliance is placed upon this data. We subscribe to various third party reports on the flooring industry which to an extent match and compare us to our competitors and whilst valid snap-shots of the sector they are limited. Customer satisfaction awards are always welcome and we note these in our strategic report.

### Principal decisions

The strategic report notes our approach to our Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 and we have faced many decisions in the year. We define principal decisions as those that have a significant impact on the company and/or group and/or our stakeholders. Principal decisions that are currently confidential to the group are not included in the list below. Any such decision would be included in future report and accounts if and when confidentiality is no longer a factor.

The potential impact of principal decisions on stakeholders is assessed in detail by the board. Obviously a significant number of decisions had to be made in the period of the lockdown and principally the level of manufacturing activity. The executive directors kept the board appraised and these actions are described in the strategic review and in our interim reporting. To the extent that these decisions affect employees there is a bi-annual update on group performance. Each of the principal decisions has an effect on employment and hence employees as a whole so this high level update is important to provide context for the individuals.

During the year the following were considered by the board.

#### Payment of dividends

The board considered shareholder expectations in setting these dividends, along with the cash position of the company. Cash flow projections are an important part of 

{10}------------------------------------------------

this, particularly in the current economic environment - the executive directors were tasked with keeping the board appraised of the working capital position.

#### Defined benefit (DB) pension scheme

Further to the triennial valuation of the last year and the adoption of the new funding arrangements the DB scheme has remained under review. The board had discussed with the trustees the future accrual of benefits and the trustees made clear that an equitable payment by members would see an increase in member contributions of around 12-15%. The view was that the members would not consider this appropriate and as a consequence the board tasked the executive directors with entering consultation with the employees over the closure to future accrual of the final salary pension scheme.

#### Post Covid-19 immunisation manufacturing

The success of the initial vaccine rollout in the UK, the very high efficacy of this vaccine and the alteration to selfisolation rules provided the opportunity, in the early part of the financial year, to return to more normal shift patterns and to increase output from our UK manufacturing sites. The board, however, needed to consider the impact of the lesser efficacy of vaccines in the Far East, from which we also source goods, and the ongoing lock-downs of a region that continued to take a zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 cases. In order to mitigate possible supply shortages stock levels were raised over a period of several months.

#### Approval of group budget

A key process is to each year agree budgets with our trading subsidiaries and this is presented to the board towards the end of each trading year. Having regard to the unprecedented situation across our markets regarding ongoing supply chain issues re the pandemic and the Ukrainian conflict with the energy crisis a budgetary process this year would be neither accurate nor a useful use of time. The Board, therefore, has assessed progress against the prior year comparative. This year a budget (i.e. for 2022/23) process has been followed but, again, the flow of trade is still far from normal. In the normal course of budget preparation manning levels and shift patterns are assessed and this effect of working hours disseminated to the various departmental employees. Our business, as with many others, is still experiencing unprecedented levels of absenteeism and huge increases in energy costs both of which present challenges to the manufacturing process.

#### Warehouse expansion

In 2020 the board appraised the need for increased warehouse capacity in the UK and plans are being finalised for final approval. The board has agreed this in principle and the cost of this expansion will be in excess of £15 million (excluding stock holdings).

Some progress has been made on this project. The land identified has been granted approval and environmental considerations are being addressed and the scale of the project agreed.

#### Price increases

The increase in costs over many months has been widely reported and, we, in common with many other companies have had to increase our prices and will undoubtedly have to do so again. The board has been, and remains, ever conscious of the effect of price increases on demand and it was resolved that price increases should, to an extent, lag cost increases to mitigate this risk. As manufacturers we make no holding gain on stock on hand subsequent to a price increase. Many stockists make gains on the stock they hold, in effect increasing prices to their customers in advance of the adverse margin effect and this can give us a degree of knowledge of the effect of increases.The increases in cost and availability concerns that were constant through the Covid-19 crisis did seem to alleviate in the autumn of 2021 though the cost of international freight continued to climb into early 2022. This situation significantly worsened since February 2022 – when the Ukraine was invaded.

Price increases have been several during the year and continue to the time of writing. Flooring contracts can take several months from initial quotation to supply and it has become ever more difficult to hold to the initial quotations. To the extent that we have tried to work with end users on these projects margins have eroded.

#### Ukraine conflict

Since February 2022 the fragility of global supply markets has worsened as the implications of the Ukraine conflict became clearer.

The board resolved that we should cease to undertake sales of flooring to Russia and given the close involvement of Belarus to only supply the latter with healthcare related products (after a review by the board of individual projects).

The effects on UK energy costs have been widely reported but the implications to UK manufacture go much deeper. Certainly the cost of our UK energy of both gas and electricity has been significant but the effects on raw material supplies have also been significant. The dependency of many industries in Europe on the large refinery and chemical plants being fed oil and gas from Russia made it immediately apparent that the conflict would lead to major disruptions in supply beyond the cost of energy. The Nord Stream 1 pipe line supplying gas is significant but more disruptive to our supply chain is the Druzhba oil pipe line. For these reasons the board resolved to try and increase stock levels. The resultant record level of year end stock is a consequence.

### Financial Director's Review continued

### Principal business risks and uncertainties

The ongoing pandemic continues to be an uncertainty, though very much lower in our risk analysis given the vaccine roll outs across the globe. The actions we take will necessarily evolve.We have detailed procedures to minimise risk of transmission within our business. During the year with employees self-isolating and shielding we have struggled to run all of our production lines at once and there has been overtime costs of employees covering for those absent. Many governments have offered a range of financial support packages to help companies and these have been taken advantage of where appropriate. There is little doubt that whilst we offered secure employment there was among a number of people a degree of resentment that other people were paid to stay at home, not within the organisation but within the economy in general.

The situation regarding the UK leaving the EU ("Brexit") is still an ongoing uncertainty. The availability and free flow of raw materials has been disrupted and where the complexities of the pandemic have superimposed themselves on the issue of border controls. The transport industry has not seen a normal period of activity and in the melee includes a mix of increased paperwork, employee shortages and excess demand. The increases in fuel and energy costs, most particularly since February 2022, has added to the uncertainties.

The Ukraine conflict has become a significant risk and uncertainty and the inter-dependencies of global markets goes far beyond energy. Just one example is the effect on wood pulp and the manufacture of wood laminate flooring. This is not a flooring that we manufacture or supply but it has vastly increased in cost as a direct result of the Ukraine invasion. Across Europe the production of urea has been disrupted in Croatia, Spain, Italy and Germany which affects to availability of "ad-blue" which is essential to vehicle transport. Just one example of the risks that indirectly impact on our group. The point is reported in the key decisions of the year.

The board constantly assesses risks and discusses business issues regularly. To the extent risk is insurable the board is risk averse and the group is widely insured.A comprehensive insurance appraisal takes place annually to mitigate exposure to risks, such as business interruption and fire but obviously key risks such as escalating raw material prices and energy costs fall outside any insurable event. Inevitably the unexpected cannot be anticipated but given the depth of understanding of our principal business by the senior management, and the board, risk is ameliorated but not eliminated.

Our goals are simple and we avoid over-stretching our capabilities. During the year the unknowns associated with the pandemic were a key unknown and consequently a key risk. Our plans are not limited to a twelve month set of figures, though budgets are prepared and monitored, and we look to benefit from decisions over a longer time frame. A major mitigation of risk is a close understanding of our people, their motivations, experience and limitations. In general it is in the nature of the board to talk about and focus on the problems of our business. This is the major way in which risk is not merely identified but mitigated. Excess capacity exists in our businesses and across Europe.

The risks identified beyond insured events include foreign exchange risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and key management. There are, additionally, key customers and key suppliers which create dependencies. Sales and purchasing policies are under regular review to assess these dependencies. In the main, risk and control are measured and assessed from a financial perspective, but this is not to the exclusion of non-financial risks and uncertainties. It is clear that scenarios can be envisaged where the group's activities may be disrupted and little could be done to mitigate the negative effects.

In terms of credit risk certain companies have insurance in place and where there is no insurance we often require letters of credit or bills of exchange but fundamentally credit control and market awareness are important. Our cash balances, and bank facilities combined with a robust balance sheet are buffers against liquidity risk.

In respect of exchange risk, the group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk on both sales and purchases that are denominated in currencies other than sterling. Those giving rise to the most significant risk are US dollar, euro and Australian dollar. To mitigate risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations the group's policy is to hedge known and forecast transactions. This hedging is at least 25% and on occasion, albeit rarely, more than 100% of the next year's anticipated exposure. IFRS 7 dictates several disclosures on risk and we have undertaken a market risk sensitivity analysis on fluctuations in our major currency exposure and the effects on the financial assets and liabilities in the balance sheet (which is included in the notes to the accounts).

Several external factors can be envisaged that would affect operating activities. These include technical failures, labour disputes outside our businesses, availability of raw materials, and import or customs delays. Given the spread of our operating activities there is a reduced risk of any single event being catastrophic, but external factors are an area of risk that continues to be monitored. Certain suppliers would be difficult to replace or their products to substitute and delays could be of several weeks duration, 

{12}------------------------------------------------

which wouldn't be covered by our current levels of stock holding. Given the length of service of many senior managers, succession planning becomes a risk and/or an uncertainty but again the open style of decision making and collaboration mitigate the risk.

The activity and progress of our competitors is a significant risk. Whether there is a new innovation or a gain in competitive advantage by a new process, or the loss of market share by any means, any effect on our volume throughput will have an effect on profitability. The board looks for market intelligence, and devotes significant time to understanding the strategy of our competitors. It is clear that the success this business has achieved over the last twenty years leads our competitors to scour all information we publish for data on our activities.

I would note that we have overseas subsidiaries with significant profit and assets which are translated at average exchange rates (in the case of profit and loss items) and at year end rates (in the case of balance sheet items). The effect of this is shown annually in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Inevitably there is a translational exposure on these items and since they are not necessarily cash flows (excepting dividend payments) the consolidated net worth of the group varies over time.We do not hedge this translational exposure though we have in the past hedged overseas assets with matching debt. At present the cost and complexity in terms of arranging facilities and complying with local taxation rules would seem to outweigh the benefits.

The last five years of these exposures in terms of increase/(decrease) in the value of our overseas assets are as follows:

|      | £'000 |
|------|-------|
| 2022 | 926   |
| 2021 | (615) |
| 2020 | 336   |
| 2019 | (170) |
| 2018 | (759) |

Aside from the strategic, operational and financial risks described there are also compliance risks relating to the legal and regulatory requirements of the various markets in which we operate. Directors and senior management are involved in health and safety, duty and customs clearance, waste management and other such issues.

### Defined benefit pension scheme

In common with other long established businesses we have the complications and uncertainty associated with having a "final salary" pension scheme. The scheme has been closed to new entrants since 2002 and was only offered to UK based employees; of our UK based work force around 20% of employees are members of this scheme. We are currently in consultation with members over the closure of the scheme to ongoing accrual and given the large changesin interest rates, gilt yields and the upswing in non Covid-19 related excess death we have instigated another formal valuation of the scheme. It may well be that the "deficit" identified at the last valuation has significantly dwindled or may be a "surplus".

Accounting for this defined benefit scheme is prescribed by IAS 19 and the quantum of the deficit or surplus is ever more volatile due to the nature of using current (higher – but still historically low) gilt yields and arguably over prudent assumptions as driven by the actuarial profession.

The scheme comprises active members (existing employees), deferred members (past employees not yet in retirement) and pensioners. Under the current accounting standard for pensions the currentservice costs of active members are dealt with in the income statement with actuarial gains/losses on the accrued benefits dealt with through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.This year there is a net actuarial gain of £7.1 million against a net actuarial gain in 2021 of £12.7 million.

## Section 172 Statement

The directors and the board as a collective consider that they acted in a way that would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole (having regard to the stakeholders and matters set out in S172(1) (a) to (f) of the Act) in the decisions taken during the year ended 30 June 2022.

The group comprises business units in various locations worldwide, all of which have engagement with their local stakeholders and other companies within the group structure. The group's governance delegation of authority allows decisions to be made at business unit level up to defined limits, which allows them to take account of the needs of their local stakeholders through their decisions implemented locally. The board routinely monitors these decisions and ultimately takes responsibility for the interaction with all stakeholders.

In consideration of major matters discussed at board level, the likely impact on all stakeholders are carefully considered and where possible, decisions are carefully explained and discussed with affected stakeholders before actions are implemented to ensure they understand and have any necessary support.

The group's key stakeholders and how we engage with them are set out below.

| Stakeholder group | How do we engage with them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | How has the board considered their interests?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |

## Report of the Directors

The directors are pleased to present their report, together with the audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2022.

### Results and dividends

The group results for the year and the financial position at 30 June 2022 are shown in the consolidated income statement on page 30 and the consolidated balance sheet on page 32.

The directors are recommending a final dividend of 5.50p (2021: 11.00p) per share on the ordinary share capital for payment on 16 December 2022 to those shareholders on the register at 18 November 2022. This final dividend together with the interim dividend of 2.25p (2021: 4.25p) per share paid on 10 June 2022 makes a total dividend of 7.75p (2021: 15.25p) per share for the year.

### Directors

The directors who held office during the year were as follows:

J A Wild M Halstead G R Oliver S D Hall M J Halstead R P Whiting

Mr G R Oliver and Mr S D Hall are the directors retiring by rotation, and offer themselves for re-election at the annual general meeting.

The interests of the directors and their families in the share capital of the company were as follows:

The directors consider that the board of directors include key management for all areas of the business and that there are no other key management which require disclosure.

Details of the directors' options under the terms of the executive share option scheme are set out in note 27.

### Substantial interests

As at 16 September 2022 the company had been notified of the following interests which represent 3% or more of the existing issued share capital:

|                             | Number     | %    |
|-----------------------------|------------|------|
| Rulegale Nominees           | 73,582,520 | 17.7 |
| John Halstead Settlement    | 70,894,436 | 17.0 |
| Octopus Investment Nominees | 26,250,579 | 6.3  |
| Nortrust Nominees           | 12,555,794 | 3.0  |

### Share capital

During the year new ordinary shares were issued and allotted as fully paid to enable share options to be exercised as follows:

| 11 November 2021 | 100,000 |
|------------------|---------|
| 12 November 2021 | 50,000  |
| 15 November 2021 | 62,110  |
|                  | 212,110 |

The issued share capital was increased by a bonus issue of one ordinary share for each ordinary share held at 14 January 2022, amounting to 208,372,026 shares.

### Special business at the annual general meeting

Resolution 6 renews the directors' authority to offer ordinary shareholders the opportunity to take ordinary shares in lieu of any cash dividends which may be payable prior to the Annual General Meeting in 2023.

Resolution 7 authorises the directors to allot relevant securities pursuant to section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 up to a maximum nominal amount of £6,945,901 representing approximately 33.33% of the total ordinary share capital. The authority will expire at the next Annual General Meeting of the company to be held in 2023 or six months after the next accounting reference date of the company (whichever is the earlier).

Except for the issue of shares to satisfy the exercise of share options granted under the share schemes, the board has no present intention of issuing any ordinary share capital of the company. As at the date of this document, the company holds no treasury shares.

Resolution 8 invites shareholders to renew the board's authority to issue shares for cash without first being required to offer them *pro rata* to existing shareholders. The proposed authority will terminate at the next Annual General Meeting of the company to be held in 2023 or six 

{16}------------------------------------------------

months after the next accounting reference date of the company (whichever is earlier). The authority is limited to equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 5.0% of the company's issued ordinary share capital. The resolution also contains provisions to enable the directors to deal with fractional entitlements and other practical difficulties which could arise in the event of a rights issue or similar pre-emptive offer.

Resolution 9 seeks to renew the authority of shareholders to allow the company to purchase its own shares in respect of up to 10% of the issued capital at prices not exceeding 5% above the average of the middle market quotations for the five business days preceding the purchase. The directors undertake that the authority would only be exercised if the directors were satisfied that a purchase would result in an increase in expected earnings per share and was in the best interests of the company at that time. The directors may choose to hold shares purchased under such authority in the form of treasury shares (subject to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital at any one time).

### Going concern

The directors have reviewed current performance and forecasts, combined with capital investment and expenditure commitments, and a range of trading scenarios. The group has no net borrowings and owns the freeholds on many of its premises (the most significant being four UK operating sites and two sites in Germany).

After considering current trading and forward forecasts, the directors have the reasonable expectation that the group has adequate financial resources to continue in operation, including contractual and commercial commitments, for the foreseeable future.

As the global pandemic recedes, but with many markets now facing high energy costs and supply chain concerns,the directors have considered that there may be a weakening of demand for flooring products in arriving at the conclusion above.

Fluctuations in exchange rates have been a constant factor since sterling floated in 1971. Our hedging delays the effect of sharp changes.

Working with our senior executives we have considered scenarios for the purpose of the statutory audit that involve layoffs and cessation of production in the winter months and, whilst we do not believe they are likely, have been considered to assessthe going concern concept.The cost and availability of international freight has continued to frustrate export sales and as part of the going concern review we have factored in the scenario that this will continue for several months.

Based on the above the directors are satisfied the group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of approval of the financial statements.

### Employment involvement

Within the UK we have both 25 year clubs and 40 year clubs for all employees. Many employees have worked their entire career for the group, and retaining an experienced workforce is important to our long term success. Our workforce retention rate is very high. Recruitment is biased to the local area, and we have a number of graduate recruits and offer internships to support younger people looking to develop their employment skills. We look to pass on knowledge and we are involved in skills training to the flooring industry, technical knowledge to the industry in general and involvement in the Chartered Institute of Human Resource Management's "Skills Ahead Mentoring Project". We have a floor fitting school for the industry and this is accessible to employees allowing them to gain skills for use in their own homes.

Promotion or opportunities in different departments are often recruited from within the business and is preferred to external candidates. The senior management and the directors having, in the main, come from lower positions within the business, including the executive directors of the main company. Our recycling partnership presents to senior management and staff on a regular basis to promote a better understanding of achievements and goals to involve more of our staff in sustainability.

We have a firm belief in equality and our main subsidiaries are SA8000 accredited (an independent standard for decent working environments). Also BS OHAS 18001 accredits our occupational and safety management protocols.

All our UK employees are offered pension scheme benefits with company contribution and the majority of UK employees are shareholders in the company by virtue of a long standing employee participation scheme. This is currently being reviewed to make it even more relevant to the group today. On the more personal level we operate a company supported social club for employees, we have outdoor seating, we offer bike sheds and there are shower facilities at most sites. Also there are break out zones and facilities to either buy or prepare food at all our sites. The company looks favourably on providing time for employees to undertake voluntary work.

### Report of the Directors continued

Across our sites there are regular consultation meetings with employee representatives (some with trade union representatives). Our employees are an important asset and are kept abreast of group performance at least twice a year. In terms of decisions directly affecting employees, communication is by line managers in the first instance, but the directors will discuss overall matters with designated representatives. In regard to the principal decisions of the business the board has considered the employees as a group and their wellbeing as a whole.

### Health and safety

The health and safety of the group's employees, customers and members of the general public who may be affected by the group's activities continue to be matters of primary concern. It is therefore the group's policy to manage its activities so far as to avoid causing any unnecessary or unacceptable risk to the health and safety of all those affected by its activities. In order to ensure that the group's high standards in this area are maintained, a substantial programme of training and retraining of employees took place throughout the year.

### Research and development

We remain totally committed to the continuing development of our processes and our products to both satisfy the needs of our customers and ensure that we remain at the forefront of our industry.

### Environmental policy

A policy has been issued and implemented on safeguarding against air, water, noise and land pollution.The management team constantly reviews and implements at every opportunity the most effective use of materials and energy. A number of control measures have been introduced and these, combined with materials storage and handling methods, together with training, form the basis of the environmental programme. The policy is fully endorsed by the directors and is under constant review to ensure full compliance with the UK Environmental Protection Act 1990. All employees, suppliers and contractors are made aware of the environmental policy which is also freely available to the general public and regulatory authorities.

### Emissions and energy consumption

Scope 1 and 2 consumption and carbon dioxide emission data has been calculated in line with the 2019 UK Government environmental reporting guidance. Emissions Factor Database 2021 version 1 has been used, utilising the published kWh gross calorific volume and kgCO2e emissions factors relevant for the reporting period.

Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions figures for the year ended 30 June 2021 have been restated by 1,992 Tonnes of CO2e for comparability.

The group is committed to year on year improvements in operational energy efficiency. A number of energy efficiency projects continued in the year.These included the installation of LED lighting, in conjunction with PIR sensors to ensure that lighting is not in use when not required, and lagging for extruder barrels. The group is mandated to comply with the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS), and the available energy efficiency improvements identified in phase 2 reporting are being reviewed and implemented where possible. Training in energy conservation and sustainability awareness is being considered for all staff across the business in the coming year.All these projects and initiatives reinforce the commitment to implementing an Energy & Environment strategy, which reduces energy and carbon usage, and is in line with the UK's 2050 net zero targets.

### Risk management

Information in relation to risk management and future developments can be found in the financial director's review in the strategic report.

### Directors' responsibilities statement

The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

{18}------------------------------------------------

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have, as required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, elected to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. The directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law) including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the profit or loss of the group for that period.

The directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market.

In preparing these financial statements the directors are required to:

- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
- make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
- state whether the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's transactions, to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and financial statements are made available on a website. Financial statements are published on the company's website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. The directors' responsibilities also extend to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

### Auditor

A resolution to re-appoint BDO LLP as auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

### Directors' statement as to the disclosure of information to the auditor

All of the current directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information needed by the company's auditor for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. The directors are not aware of any relevant audit information of which the auditor is unaware.

Approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the board.

## Board Report on Remuneration

### Remuneration committee

The remuneration committee comprises the non-executive directors, with Mr S D Hall, as chairman. The committee meets at least once a year, although usually more frequently, to determine the remuneration packages of the executive directors of the group.

The remuneration policy for the non-executive directors is determined by the board as a whole by reference to market rates. They do not participate in the group bonus scheme, pension scheme or share option scheme. No director can vote in regard to his own remuneration.

### Remuneration policy

The remuneration policy is to provide terms of employment such that the recruitment, motivation and retention of high calibre personnel is achieved and maintained to the mutual benefit of shareholders and employees. The committee is assisted from time to time by data supplied by independent professional remuneration consultants as to comparable companies, although identical circumstances are rarely found.

### Basic salary and bonus payments

The directors' salaries and fees for the year are disclosed in note 14. Annual bonus schemes are in place which reward the executive directors on achieving performance objectives. Performance is determined by index-linked profit improvements through a trend of earnings per share growth. UK based executives are eligible members of the employee share scheme. Performance bonuses of £500,000 to each of the group chief executive and group finance director were paid during the year. These related to the 2021 financial year.

### Share option schemes

The remuneration committee believes that share option plans are an important long term incentive to executive directors and other senior employees. They are intended to link the exercise of the option to a sustained and significant improvement in the underlying financial performance of the group.

The share option plan is reviewed by the remuneration committee and is open to executive directors and selected employees of the group. The option price per ordinary share will not be less than the market value on the day of grant.A limit of four times earnings has been placed on the value of the aggregate price payable on the exercise of all options or rights to subscribe for ordinary shares granted to an individual employee under the share option plan and under all other discretionary schemes.

### Pensions

The company operates Inland Revenue Approved defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The group chief executive and group finance director are members of the defined benefit scheme. Pension entitlements are calculated on basic salary only.

All members of the schemes are required to contribute a percentage of their pensionable earnings. Increase in pensionable salary is restricted to the increase in the consumer price index.

Other benefits within the schemes are death in service lump sums, spouse's and dependant's pensions following death in service of the member and ill health early retirement where the appropriate circumstances arise.

### Service agreements

The chairman and the group chief executive do not have service agreements. The group finance director has a service agreement which terminates within or is terminable by the company and the executive on not more than one year's notice. The remuneration committee has taken the view that notice periods of one year are reasonable and in the interests of both the company and its executive directors having regard to prevailing market conditions and current practice. Mr S D Hall, Mr M J Halstead and Mr R P Whiting each has a service contract for an initial term of two years from the date of his appointment, which can be terminated by either party by one month's written notice.

S D Hall Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

## Corporate Governance

### Chairman's introduction to governance

The board has over many years recognised its responsibility towards good corporate governance. It is part of our character and, I believe, contributes to our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value. The Financial Reporting Council and the Quoted Company Alliance have both issued guidance on governance and having assessed these codes we have aligned our approach to the latter. In many ways this is a continuing process but in the following paragraphs we outline how we effect this code and I trust our shareholders will take the time to review our comments.

It is my belief that good governance is accountability to shareholders as a whole over time rather than being swayed by current short term objectives of individual holders. For many companies some shareholders are transient and focus short term, looking for ambitious acquisitions or risky strategies and yet quick to exit at the first sign of problems. Management need to be focused on the medium to long term goal as much as current issues.

Anthony Wild Chairman

### Directors and committees

The company is controlled by the board of directors. The board consists of a non-executive chairman, two executive directors, a senior independent director and two nonexecutive directors.

The board has two sub committees: a remuneration committee and an audit committee.

He was appointed corporate development director in 2019. Working closely with the board and subsidiary directors, the role is designed to help support the future growth of the business across the globe.

### Internal control

The board has ultimate responsibility for the system of internal control operating throughout the group and for reviewing its effectiveness. Internal control systems in any group are designed to meet the particular needs of that group and the risks to which it is exposed. No system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The group's system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in order to achieve business objectives and to provide the board with reasonable assurance that potential problems will normally be prevented or will be detected in a manner which will enable appropriate action to be taken.

{22}------------------------------------------------

The key procedures which the directors have established with a view to providing effective internal control are as follows:

- the group directors are responsible for establishing, maintaining and reviewing the group's system of internal control and meet regularly to consider group financial performance, business development and management issues, and to review these against predetermined objectives;
- the group board establishes corporate strategy and business objectives. Management of subsidiary companies integrate these objectives into their business strategies for presentation to the group board with supporting financial objectives;
- subsidiary company budgets, containing financial and operating targets, capital expenditure proposals and performance/profitability indicators, are presented to and reviewed by the group executive directors. The consolidated group budget is approved by the group board;
- there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the group. These risks are appraised and evaluated by responsible executives and endorsed by subsidiary and group management. This process has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the annual accounts;
- as part of the regular monitoring and review, the group executive directors hold regular meetings with the management of the subsidiary companies at which reports covering such areas as forecasts, business development, strategic planning, risk exposure and performance against budget, are presented and discussed. These are then reported to the group board, on a quarterly basis;
- the group board reviews and considers any major problem which may have occurred and assesses how the risks have changed in the period under review;
- there is a group-wide policy governing appraisal and approval of capital expenditure and asset disposals;
- to underpin the effectiveness of controls, it is the group's policy to recruit management and staff of high calibre, integrity and appropriate disciplines. High standards of integrity, business ethics and compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies are demanded from staff at all levels;
- the audit committee keeps under review the effectiveness of the system of internal control and reports its conclusions to the full board;
- the board also conducts an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control system. This assessment consists of a review of all the significant areas of internal control, including risk assessment, the control environment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.

### The Quoted Company Alliance Code ("QCA code")

The directors recognise the importance of good corporate governance and have chosen to apply the QCA code as their framework to do so. The QCA code was developed by the Quoted Company Alliance in consultation with a number of institutional small company investors as an alternative code applicable to AIM companies. The QCA code was published in April 2018.

The QCA code sets out ten principles which seek to ensure that the overall framework for corporate governance is robust. The directors believe that this framework is appropriate to the size and operations of the business and each of the principles is commented on below. Many of the disclosures relevant to the code are already made in our annual report and accounts.

The chairman has the responsibility for corporate governance and has taken a lead on this matter. The executive team are directed with day to day management and are accountable to the rest of the board. The chairman expects and demands open discussion of issues facing the business and in the application of this code has sought input from the auditors, the company's advisors and a review by the company lawyer. The board is tasked with continuing the success of the business over time and through successive generations of management and the importance of corporate governance is to oversee the division of ownership and stewardship.The executive directors have the day to day responsibility of stewardship and the chairman and non-executives monitor and evaluate this on behalf of the owners.

James Halstead plc has been listed on the London stock exchange for over 70 years and continues to look for growth in sales and profit to continue its strong record of reward to shareholders in the form of dividend.Whilst this is a primary role, the board is proud of its reputation within its industry and the financial markets and corporate control is central to the ethos.

{23}------------------------------------------------

## Corporate Governance

#### continued

The disclosures below were last reviewed and approved by the board on 30 September 2022.

### QCA Principles and James Halstead plc's approach

#### 1. Establish a strategy and business model which promote long-term value for shareholders

James Halstead plc's strategy is explained fully within our Strategic Report section in our Report and Accounts each financial year.

Our strategy is focussed on stable profitable growth from building the goodwill in our brands and products leading to increasing dividends over time.

Key risks and mitigating factors to our business are also detailed annually in our Report and Accounts.

#### 2. Seek to understand and meet shareholder needs and expectations

The board has a track record of increasing dividends over many years. Where the business has generated funds in excess of its medium-term requirements and no specific investment requirements exist the board has also encouraged the payment of special dividends over the years.

Members of the board talk regularly to both institutional and private investors and the financial press to ensure that company's strategy and objectives are communicated. The group has a large number of shareholders and regular broker updates are published.

The company regularly hosts institution and broker site visits to update on progress and the executive directors are in ongoing contact with the nominated advisor who communicates more closely with the market.

Shareholders can contact the company secretary with questions and may be referred to the directors.

In addition, the AGM acts as a forum for all shareholders to meet with the board and raise any questions they may have.

#### 3. Take into account wider stakeholder and social responsibilities and their implications for long-term success.

The board recognises that the group has responsibilities to many stakeholders other than its shareholders. This includes employees, customers, suppliers and the wider societies in which we operate.

In terms of communications with stakeholders this is done in ways appropriate to the stakeholder and may take the form of formal announcements, individual meetings (for example appraisals with employees) and negotiations with other stakeholders.

The environmental impact of our manufacturing and our output is of significant importance to our medium term prospects not only to demonstrate our commitment to the community at large but also to customers who increasingly, and rightly, look for suppliers with strong ethical values.

As a member of the communities in which we operate the board takes seriously the impact the business has, positively in terms of being an employer and seeking continuous improvement with respect to the impact on the environment and communities. This is illustrated by our annual "Sustainability Report" copies of which are available on www.polyflor.com which outlines the impact of our manufacturing operations on the wider environment and improvements over time. Feedback from the local community is received directly to the head office. This report has been published for nearly two decades and is now an annual report.

We understand continuous development of our products also contributes to our responsibilities as well as the success of the business. This is illustrated, for example, by development of "dementia friendly" flooring in recent years.

The operating businesses encourage feedback from customers through their relationship managers in the business and customer service teams.

#### 4. Embed effective risk management, considering both opportunities and threats, throughout the organisation.

Risk management is reported annually in our Report and Accounts along with how those risks are mitigated and how they change over time.

The board meets six times a year during which business and other risks are assessed. Key subsidiaries have their own management boards which meet regularly and assess the risks relevant to that specific business and relevant responses. These are communicated to the main board either by direct representation or via group management structures that are in place. There are also formal and informal communication routes that allow for risks to be communicated to board members in a timely manner from all operational entities.

#### 5. Maintain the board as a well-functioning, balanced team led by the chair.

AnthonyWild, the non-executive chairman is responsible for the running of the board and Mark Halstead as chief executive has responsibility for implementation of the board's direction.

{24}------------------------------------------------

A monthly report is provided to the board of the financial and operational performance of the group. Information is provided in advance of meetings.

The board is responsible for all strategic decisions and the overall governance and culture of the group.

All the directors have access to the services and advice of the company secretary and are able to take independent professional advice to enable them to do so.This may be done at the group's expense.

The board has a majority of non-executive directors and consider that they bring independent thought and judgement to bear as well as business experience out-with the group.

The board has sub committees with specific remits, specifically remuneration and audit committees and detail of the number of meetings and attendance by directors is noted in the Annual Report.

#### 6. Ensure that between them the directors have the necessary up-to-date experience, skills and capabilities

The board evaluates consistently those skills that are required and whether they are adequately provided for. In doing so and where relevant it will consider guidance available on appointment and training of board members. The Company Secretary has the responsibility to make the board aware of legal changes and will advise on the company's approach. For example the recent GDPR requirements and previously the Market Abuse Regulations (MAR).

The company secretary supports the chairman in addressing the training and development needs of the directors. In the case of new directors there is an induction process to ensure they become aware of the operations of the group.

The directors are aware of their individual responsibility to undertake appropriate continuing development.

#### 7. Evaluate board performance based on clear and relevant objectives seeing continuous improvement.

The board will take account of the Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Board Effectiveness as it evaluates on a regular basis its performance. The remuneration committee meets formally and is tasked with not only the remuneration of the executive directors but also evaluation of performance. To this end the board is circulated with press comment and market feedback on the business. Market share data and peer group analysis is available.

In terms of the financial performance the auditors meet the audit committee (comprising the non-executives) biannually and beyond the audit report do comment on the systems, procedures and efficacy of the management. The nominated advisor has access to the Chairman and meets the non-executives annually.

A rigorous recruitment process is undertaken for new directors prior to their proposal and election. In terms of reelection their performance is reconsidered prior to them being proposed to ensure they remain effective in their role and that they retain their independence.

Re-election is considered by the shareholders at the AGM at which shareholders have the opportunity as a body to approve or otherwise board membership. Succession planning for the board and as importantly the key executives around the world who manage our businesses is an ongoing topic of discussion.

#### 8. Promote a corporate culture that is based on ethical values and behaviours.

The board expects the highest ethical standards of its members and management across the group.

The group has documented procedures with respect to its responsibilities regarding ethical behaviour, specifically bribery and corrupt practices and modern slavery and these are applicable across its operations including supply and customer chains.

The board also takes seriously its responsibilities towards sustainability of its operations and the impact of our operations on the environment. This is documented and reported on annually in Polyflor's Sustainability Report.

As an employer and member of many communities throughout the world, the board consider that strong ethical values to be a good member of these communities is a mindset not one underpinned by rules and procedures. Ensuring, via recruitment processes and cultural values that this cascades through the business is critical to ensuring the group is a "good member of the community".All directors of the group's companies are expected to comply and are given a manual on procedures and expectations. This covers authority levels and gives guidance on appropriate behaviour.

Ultimately service contracts underpin this by indicating behaviour that can be deemed a breach of contract and the directors are clear about their statutory duties as formally set out in sections 171 – 177 of the Companies Act 2006.

## Corporate Governance

#### continued

#### 9. Maintain governance structures and processes that are fit for purpose and support good decision making by the board

Corporate governance disclosures are assessed at least annually, including whether the structures and processes are fit for purpose.

The board retains ultimate accountability for maintaining good governance. The executive directors are responsible for the day-to-day operational management of the group and the non-executive directors are responsible for bringing their independent and objective judgement to board discussions and decisions. The roles of chairman and chief executive are split in accordance with best practice. The board are responsible for the implementation of strategy, the achievement of performance and ensuring the framework of internal controls is effective. The board has delegated specific responsibilities to the audit and remuneration committees.

The audit committee assists the board by ensuring that the financial performance of the group is properly reported. It oversees and reviews the internal control processes, its relationship with external auditors and the process for ensuring compliance with laws, regulations and corporate governance.

The remuneration committee is responsible for establishing a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on remuneration and to set the remuneration packages of individual directors, including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options.

Due the nature and size of the company, the directors have determined that a nomination committee is not necessary and that issues concerning the nomination of directors will be dealt with by the board directly.

- 10. Communicate how the company is governed and is performing by maintaining a dialogue with shareholders and other relevant stakeholders
The AGM is a key forum for communications with any shareholders who wish to attend, and the directors are available here to listen to views expressed both formally and informally. This combined with the normal cycle of announcements is the key method of communication. The outcome of resolutions put to the AGM are published and are available on the company website.

In terms of publication of results, the company uses the Stock Exchange regulatory news service (RNS) to advise the market (i.e. shareholders and others) of performance and significant matters. As a group we do not find social media (Facebook, twitter etc.) an appropriate medium for dissemination of news due to the "sound-bite" nature of the medium. Brokers are updated and circulate notes regularly.

The group has, where appropriate, communications with major institutional and private shareholders and encourages dialogue.

## Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of James Halstead plc

### Opinion on the financial statements

In our opinion:

- the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 30 June 2022 and of the group's profit for the year then ended;
- the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards;
- the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements of James Halstead plc (the 'parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group') for the year ended 30 June 2022 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and the Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and notes to the consolidated and Parent Company financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and UK adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

### Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

#### *Independence*

We remain independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

### Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group and the parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

- Examining the directors' business plan covering the period to October 2023. We examined the cash flow forecasts for key judgements, verifying to source data as appropriate, as well as considering downside sensitivities to these;
- Testing their mechanical accuracy and assessing historical forecast accuracy;
- Challenge of the directors' stress test scenarios including levers available to the directors to mitigate the impacts;
- Challenge of the directors on the key assumptions included in the scenarios and confirmed the directors' mitigating actions are within their control; and
- Assessing the adequacy of the disclosures within the financial statements relating to the directors' assessment of the going concern basis of preparation.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

#### Overview

#### *Coverage*

- 99% (2021: 97%) of Group profit before tax
- 90% (2021: 90%) of Group revenue
- 95% (2021: 96%) of Group total assets

#### *Key audit matters*

|----------------------------|------|------|
| Inventory provisioning     | ✓    | ✓    |
| Pension scheme assumptions | ✓    | ✓    |

#### *Materiality*

Group financial statements as a whole: £2.60m (2021: £2.56m) based on 5% of profit before tax (2021: 5% of profit before tax).

#### An overview of the scope of our audit

Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including the group's system of internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including assessing whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that may have represented a risk of material misstatement.

Our group audit scope focused on the group's principal operating locations being the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. The operations in the United Kingdom, which were deemed to be significant components, were subject to a full scope audit given the statutory audit requirements whilst the significant components in Germany and Australia were also subject to a full scope audit to component materiality. The German component was audited by a non-BDO member firm. The Australian component was audited by a BDO member firm. The remaining components of the group were considered non-significant and these components were principally subject to analytical review procedures by the group engagement team.

#### *Our involvement with component auditors*

For the work performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement needed in order to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. Our involvement with component auditors included the following:

The German operations form a significant part of group turnover and profitability. As part of our audit strategy, the Responsible Individual and senior members of the group audit team were involved during the planning and risk assessment process of the German component in addition to during the completion of detailed audit procedures. We attended key meetings with component management and auditors, and reviewed component auditor work papers.

The Australian operations form a further significant part of group turnover and profits. Again the Responsible Individual and senior members of the group audit team were involved at all stages of the audit process, directing the planning and risk assessment work performed through calls with the component auditors and local management. Reviews of the component auditor working papers were also completed.

#### *Key audit matters*

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team.These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

#### Key audit matter – Inventory provisioning

As described in Note 2 (accounting policies) and Note 19 (inventories), the group carries inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Provision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged inventories. As at 30 June 2022, the group held inventories of £112.3m (2021: £60.7m).

This area represented a key audit matter as significant management judgement is required to assess the appropriate level of provisioning for items which may be sold below cost or written off as a result of a reduction in consumer demand particularly in light of changing consumer tastes and new products being developed. Such judgements include management's expectations for future sales.

{28}------------------------------------------------

#### *How the scope of our audit addressed the key audit matter*

We obtained evidence concerning management's assumptions applied in calculating the value of inventory provisions by:

> Challenging the group's inventory provisioning policy with specific consideration given to slow moving or obsolete stock lines. This involved a review of production and sales records for a sample of products to ascertain when they were last made or sold and whether they had been appropriately provided for;

> assessing the appropriateness of the percentages applied within the provision by reviewing historic sales and the ageing of stock; and

> testing of a sample of inventory to confirm it is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value, through comparison to invoices for cost and sales prices.

We also audited the basis of stock provisioning applied by all group entities and considered whether these were being applied consistently and reflected the nature of the stock held in each location.

Key observation: Our work did not highlight evidence that the method of inventory provision was inappropriate.

#### Key audit matter – Pension scheme assumptions

As described in Note 2 (accounting policies) and Note 26 (retirement benefit obligations), the group has a defined benefit pension plan in the UK.

At 30 June 2022, the group recorded a net retirement benefit of £6.1m (2021: £4.4m obligation), comprising scheme assets of £69.2m (2021: £77.3m) and scheme liabilities of £63.1m (2021: £81.6m).

The pension valuation is dependent on market conditions and key assumptions made by management, in particular relating to investment markets, discount rate, inflation expectations and life expectancy assumptions.

This area and the related disclosures represented a key audit matter given that the setting of these assumptions is complex and requires the exercise of significant management judgement with the support of third party actuaries.

In testing the pension valuation, with the help of external pension actuarial experts, we reviewed the key actuarial assumptions used, both financial and demographic, and considered the appropriateness of the methodology utilised to derive these assumptions.

We benchmarked the scheme assumptions against other schemes of a similar size and profile. Specifically, we challenged the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions applied in the calculation by using pension experts to benchmark the assumptions applied against comparable third party data and assessed the appropriateness of the assumptions in the context of the group's own position. We have also performed sensitivity analysis on the assumptions determined by the directors.

We have tested the accuracy of the scheme asset statements by reference to service organisation control reports to gain assurance over the robustness of the provider's internal controls. Further, we have sample tested assets to third party sources in order to confirm ownership and valuation

Furthermore, we have assessed the disclosure of the net pension asset and the related assumptions and sensitivities in the financial statements against the relevant accounting framework.

Key observation: We have not identified any evidence to suggest that the methodology and assumptions applied in relation to determining the pension valuation are not within an acceptable range. Furthermore, the disclosures made are in accordance with the relevant accounting framework.

#### Our application of materiality

We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. We consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements.

In order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.

{29}------------------------------------------------

## Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of James Halstead plc continued

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole and performance materiality as follows:

|                                | Group financial statements          |                                   |  |  |

|                                | Parent company financial statements |                                   |  |  |

| Performance materiality £1.05m |                          | £1.08m                   |

Rationale for the benchmark applied – Pre-tax profit is determined to be a stable basis of assessing business performance and is considered to be the most significant determinant of performance used by shareholders.

Basis for determining performance materiality – 65% of the above materiality level. This is considered the appropriate basis given the multiple significant components across three geographic regions (United Kingdom, Germany and Australia), the level of misstatements in the past and our overall risk assessment.

#### *Component materiality*

We set materiality for each significant component of the group based on a percentage of between 20% and 70% of group materiality dependent on the size and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement of that component. Component materiality ranged from £0.52m to £1.82m. In the audit of each component, we further applied performance materiality levels of 65% of the component materiality to our testing to ensure that the risk of errors exceeding component materiality was appropriately mitigated.

#### *Reporting threshold*

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all individual audit differences in excess of £52,000 (2021: £51,260).We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

### Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Report and Accounts 2022 other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

### Other Companies Act 2006 reporting

Based on the responsibilities described below and our work performed during the course of the audit, we are required by the Companies Act 2006 and ISAs (UK) to report on certain opinions and matters as described below.

#### *Strategic report and directors' report*

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
- the Strategic report and the Directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors' report.

{30}------------------------------------------------

#### *Matters on which we are required to report by exception*

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
- the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
- certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

### Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

### Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

#### *Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud*

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

Based on our understanding and accumulated knowledge of the group and the sector in which it operates we considered the risk of acts by the group which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud and whether such actions or non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. These included but were not limited to those that relate to the form and content of the financial statements, such as the group accounting policies, international accounting standards, the UK Companies Act 2006 and the QCA Code; those that relate to the payment of employees; and industry related such as compliance with health and safety requirements.

We assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement including fraud and evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls) and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries, revenue recognition and management bias in accounting estimates.

Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to:

- Obtaining an understanding of the control environment in monitoring compliance with laws and regulations;
- Enquiring of management concerning potential litigations and claims;
- Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;
- Reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;
- Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the group's defined benefit pension scheme liabilities, accruals, stock provisions (as set out in the key audit matters section above) and forecasts used within impairment models utilised to assess goodwill impairment;

{31}------------------------------------------------

## Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of James Halstead plc continued

- A critical assessment of the consolidation and consideration of manual or late journals posted at consolidation level;
- Identification and testing of journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account combinations or including specific keywords using data analytics; and
- Agreement of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation.

We communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members, including the component auditors, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit. Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery, misrepresentations or through collusion. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

### Use of our report

This report is made solely to the parent company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the parent company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the parent company and the parent company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

### 1. General information

James Halstead plc ("the company" or "the parent company") is a limited liability company, registered in England and Wales, domiciled in the United Kingdom and listed onAIM on the London Stock Exchange.The address of its registered office is Beechfield, Hollinhurst Road, Radcliffe, Manchester, M26 1JN.

### 2. Accounting policies

#### Basis of preparation

On 31 December 2020, IFRS as adopted by the European Union at that date was brought into UK Law and became UK adopted international accounting standards, with future changes being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The group transitioned to UK adopted international accounting standards in its consolidated financial statements on 1 July 2021. There was no impact or changes in accounting from the transition.

The group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards. The company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, and are presented separately following the group financial statements.

The group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on the historical cost basis as modified by the valuation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities (being derivative instruments) at fair value.

#### Going concern

The directors have reviewed current performance and forecasts, combined with capital investment and expenditure commitments, and a range of trading scenarios. The group has no net borrowings and owns the freeholds on many of its premises (the most significant being four UK operating sites and two sites in Germany).

After considering current trading and forward forecasts, the directors have the reasonable expectation that the group has adequate financial resources to continue in operation, including contractual and commercial commitments, for the foreseeable future.

As the global pandemic recedes, but with many markets now facing high energy costs and supply chain concerns,the directors have considered that there may be a weakening of demand for flooring products in arriving at the conclusion above.

Fluctuations in exchange rates have been a constant factor since sterling floated in 1971. Our hedging delays the effect of sharp changes.

Working with our senior executives we have considered scenarios for the purpose of the statutory audit that involve layoffs and cessation of production in the winter months and,whilst we do not believe they are likely, have been considered to assess the going concern concept. The cost and availability of international freight has continued to frustrate export sales and as part of the going concern review we have factored in the scenario that this will continue for several months.

Based on the above the directors are satisfied the group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of approval of the financial statements.

#### Recent accounting developments

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and interpretations in force at the reporting date.The group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.

{38}------------------------------------------------

### 2. Accounting policies (continued)

#### Recent accounting developments (continued)

The following standards were adopted in the period.

Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2

There were no new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are not yet effective and have not been adopted early in these financial statements, which will or may have an effect on the group's future financial statements.

#### Basis of consolidation

The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the parent company and all its subsidiaries, as if they formed a single entity. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control exists if all three of the following elements are present: power over the entity, exposure to variable returns from the entity, and the ability to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control. Control is normally achieved by a majority shareholding. The company, directly or through an intermediate subsidiary owned 100% of the share capital of all of its subsidiaries.The results of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated from the date on which control passes to the group. The results of disposed subsidiaries are consolidated up to the date on which control passes from the group. All intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.

#### Segment reporting

Operating segments are those segments for which results are reviewed by the group's chief operating decision maker (CODM) to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. The CODM is the group board which meets regularly throughout the year to discuss the performance and results of the group as a whole. The business of the group is the manufacture and distribution of flooring products. The group operates through separate legal entities in certain areas of the world and in order to provide information in a structured manner to readers of the accounts who are unfamiliar with the internal management reporting of the group, these operations are discussed by the chief executive in his report. However, the directors consider that under the definitions contained within IFRS 8 there is only one reportable segment,which is the group as a whole.This is consistent with the core principle of IFRS 8, which is to disclose information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which the group engages and the economic activities in which it operates.

#### Foreign currencies

Functional and presentation currency – the group's consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the functional currency of the parent company, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the parent company operates.

Transactions and balances – transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on retranslating monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where they relate to qualifying cash flow hedges, in which case the exchange differences are deferred in equity.

Foreign subsidiaries – the results of foreign subsidiaries (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy), that have a functional currency different from the group's presentation currency, are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year.

Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, that have a functional currency different from the group's presentation currency, are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries and their opening net assets are recognised as a separate component of equity.

When a foreign subsidiary is sold the cumulative exchange differences relating to the retranslation of the net investment in that foreign subsidiary are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. This applies only to exchange differences recorded in equity after 1 July 2006. Exchange differences arising prior to 1 July 2006 remain in equity on disposal as permitted by IFRS 1.

### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

### 2. Accounting policies (continued)

#### Intangible assets

Goodwill – goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the fair value of any previously held interests, and the recognised value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment review, goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating unit (CGU) within the group. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying value of the goodwill or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the UK GAAP value as at that date having been reviewed for impairment at that date and subsequently at least annually.

#### Taxation

Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income.

Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to taxation authorities based on tax rates and laws that are enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their corresponding book values as recorded in the group's financial statements with the following exceptions:

- where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
- deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised;
- deferred income tax is not provided on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries where there is no likelihood to remit the earnings.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on tax rates and laws that are substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

#### Share-based payments

The group grants share options to certain of its employees.An expense in relation to such options based on their fair value at the date of grant, is recognised over the vesting period.The group uses the Black Scholes model for the purpose of computing fair value.

#### Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a weighted average cost basis. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of finished and partly finished goods, cost represents the cost of raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads on bases consistently applied from year to year. In all cases provision is made for obsolete,slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.

#### Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables.

{40}------------------------------------------------

### 2. Accounting policies (continued)

#### Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially stated at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost less provision for lifetime expected credit losses using the simplified approach in IFRS 9. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience and forward looking information, together with specific amounts that are not expected to be collectable. Individual amounts are written off when management deems them not to be collectible.

#### Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, short-term (with an original maturity of three months or less) deposits and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are disclosed as current liabilities except where the group participates in offset arrangements with certain banks whereby cash and overdraft amounts are offset against each other. Cash and cash equivalents are held at amortised cost.

#### Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are initially stated at fair value and then subsequently at amortised cost.

#### Pension scheme arrangements

The group operates several defined contribution pension schemes and a defined benefit pension scheme for certain of its United Kingdom domiciled employees.

A defined contribution scheme is a scheme in which the group pays contributions into publicly or privately administered schemes on a voluntary, statutory or contractual basis. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been made. The amount charged to the income statement is the contribution payable in the year. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

A defined benefit scheme is a scheme in which the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined. For the defined benefit scheme, pension costs and the costs of providing other post retirement benefits are charged to the income statement in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.The service cost is charged against operating profit and the net interest cost is charged as a finance cost. The net interest cost is calculated using the discount rate at the beginning of the period. The retirement benefit obligations recognised on the balance sheet represent the difference between the fair value of the scheme's assets and the present value of the scheme's defined benefit obligations measured at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligations are recognised in the period in which they arise in other comprehensive income.A net defined benefit obligations asset is recognised to the extent that the group can realise an economic benefit from that asset.

#### Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment except for land which is shown at cost less any impairment. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Depreciation is calculated on the depreciable amount (being cost less the estimated residual value) on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Freehold land: Not depreciated Freehold buildings: 10 to 50 years Plant and equipment: 2 to 20 years

Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each group balance sheet date for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment and adjusted if appropriate.

#### Right of use assets and lease liabilities

A right of use asset and a lease liability are recognised for all leased asset contracts on their commencement, except for low value leases and short term leases of one year or less.

On recognition, the right of use asset and lease liability are measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted over the lease term.The discount rate used is the rate inherent in the lease if this can be determined, or the incremental borrowing rate.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the right of use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. The lease liabilities are increased by the interest cost and reduced by the lease payments made. A depreciation charge and an interest cost are recognised in the income statement.

The lease payments for low value and short term leases are expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.

#### Revenue recognition

Revenue is from the sales of flooring products and is recognised at the point in time when control of the products has been transferred to the customer. Sales are recognised on despatch of the goods to the customer. Control passes to the customer at the point terms of despatch are met. Sales are invoiced at the time of despatch and payment terms are based on the invoice date. Payment terms vary by customer, but do not exceed six months. Revenue is stated after provision for trade discounts and rebates due on the sales. Revenue excludes VAT and sales taxes.

#### Research and development

Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.

Development expenditure not meeting all the criteria for capitalisation contained in IAS 38 – Intangible Assets, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.

#### Grants

Grants that compensate for expenses are recognised in the income statement in the same period and category in which the expenses are recognised.

#### Dividends

Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders.

#### Derivative financial instruments and hedging

The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency transactional risk. In accordance with its treasury policy the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each group balance sheet date.

The method by which any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognised depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The group recognises an instrument as a hedging instrument by documenting at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the instrument and the hedged items and the objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction.To be designated as a hedging instrument, an instrument must also be assessed, at inception and on an ongoing basis, to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.

{42}------------------------------------------------

### 2. Accounting policies (continued)

#### Derivative financial instruments and hedging (continued)

For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or of a highly probable forecast future transaction,the gain or loss on remeasurement which relates to the portion of the hedge which is deemed effective is recognised directly in equity, with the balance of the gain or loss, relating to the ineffective portion, being recognised immediately in the income statement.

Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.

### 3. Financial risk management

#### Financial risk and treasury policies

A full description of the James Halstead plc group's treasury policy is contained in the financial director's review.

The group's activities expose it to a number of financial risks as detailed below. These risks are managed, with the objective of limiting adverse effects, from the group's head office in accordance with policies determined by and decisions made by the group board.

There have been no changes in financial risks from the previous year.

#### Market risks

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices,such as currency exchange rates and interest rates will affect the group's results. The objective of market risk management is to control it within suitable parameters.

#### (a) Foreign exchange risk

The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity making the sale or purchase.There are a range of currencies giving rise to this risk, but most significant is the euro. To mitigate risks associated with future exchange rate fluctuations, the group's policy is to use forward exchange contracts to hedge its known and certain forecast transaction exposures based on historical experience and projections. The group hedges at least 25% but rarely more than 100% of the next twelve months' anticipated exposure.

#### (b) Interest rate risk

The group does not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk. The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling deposits which are made on floating market based rates and short-term overdrafts in foreign currencies which are also on floating rates.

{43}------------------------------------------------

### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

### 3. Financial risk management (continued)

#### Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the group's trade receivables from customers and monies on deposit with financial institutions.

With regard to trade receivables,the group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk. Exposure is spread across a large number of companies and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary across the world. Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the individual operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate. Where practicable and deemed necessary the group endeavours to minimise credit risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.

The group controls credit risk in relation to counterparties to other financial instruments by dealing only with highly rated financial institutions.

The group's maximum credit exposure on financial assets is represented by their book value.

#### Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.

#### Capital risk

The group's objectives in managing capital are to safeguard the ability of all entities within the group to continue as going concerns, whilst maximising the overall return to shareholders over time. The capital structure of the group consists of equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company less cash and cash equivalents.

The group will only usually take on borrowings where those borrowings would be financed by the cash expected to be generated by the related investment opportunity and where the borrowing would not significantly increase the group's exposure to risk.

At the year end the group had preference shares classified as debt of £200,000.

### 4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of certain estimates and associated assumptions that affect the application of policies, the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Although these estimates are based on management's best assessments of amounts, events or actions, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis. There are no significant judgements.

The estimates that have had the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows:

{44}------------------------------------------------

### 4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)

#### Inventories

For financial reporting purposes the group evaluates its inventory to ensure it is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Provision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged inventories. Damaged inventories are identified and written down through the inventory counting procedures conducted within each business. Provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories is assessed by each business as part of their ongoing financial reporting. Obsolescence is assessed based on comparison of the level of inventory holding to the projected likely future sales. Future sales are assessed based on historical experience, and adjusted where the market conditions are known to have changed. To the extent that future events impact the saleability of inventory these provisions could vary significantly. For example, changes in specifications or regulations may render inventory, previously considered to have a realisable value in excess of cost, obsolete and require such inventory to be fully written off.

#### Expected credit losses

Provision is made against trade receivables for lifetime expected credit losses using the simplified approach in IFRS 9.Within each of the operating units, assessment is made locally of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and forward looking information. Determining the recoverability of an account involves estimation as to the likely financial condition of the customer and their ability to subsequently make payment. If the group is cautious as to the financial condition of the customer the group may provide for accounts that are subsequently recovered. Similarly, if the group is optimistic as to the financial condition of the customer, the group may not provide for an account that is subsequently determined to be irrecoverable. In recent years the group has not experienced significant variation in the amount charged to the income statement in respect of doubtful accounts,when compared to sales. Further details are provided in note 20.

#### Income taxes

In determining the group's provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.

#### Retirement benefit obligations

The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, inflation, salary increases, and the rate at which liabilities are discounted. Any change in these assumptions would impact the retirement benefit obligations recognised. Further details on these estimates are provided in note 26.

### 5. Segmental information

Operating segments are those segments for which results are reviewed by the group's chief operating decision maker (CODM) to assess performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated. The CODM is the group board which meets regularly throughout the year to discuss the performance and results of the group as a whole. The business of the group is focussed almost entirely on the manufacture and distribution of flooring products.The directors consider that under the definitions contained within IFRS 8 there is only one reportable segment,which is the group as a whole.This is consistent with the core principle of IFRS 8,which is to disclose information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities in which the group engages and the economic activities in which it operates. Therefore the majority of the disclosures required under IFRS 8 have already been given in these financial statements.

Segment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, right of use and intangible assets. Geographical disclosures in respect of revenues and segment assets are provided below and include revenue for Germany of £62,553,000 (2021: £55,656,000) and assets in Germany of £9,016,000 (2021: £10,560,000).

### 6. Employee profit share

Profit for the year is after charging the cost of the James Halstead plc share ownership plan. Since 1980 the group has operated an employee share scheme, approved under the FinanceAct 1978. In December 2001 the shareholders approved a new share ownership plan in line with the requirements of legislative changes. The aim of this scheme is to enable employees to build up a personal shareholding in James Halstead plc and to participate in its continued expansion and success as shareholders as well as employees.

As members of the scheme the following directors received shares to the value of, Mr M Halstead £nil and Mr G R Oliver £nil.

### 26. Retirement benefit obligations

In the UK the group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which was closed to new members in 2002. In addition some employees both in the UK and overseas are provided with retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements. Executive directors Mr M Halstead and Mr G R Oliver are members of the defined benefit scheme and the employer pension contributions for the year were £25,000 and £nil respectively. At 30 June 2022 the accrued pension for the highest paid director was £131,000 and the transfer value of this accrued benefit was £2,557,000.

Disclosures relating to the defined benefits pension scheme are as follows:

The company sponsors the Halstead Group Pension Scheme, a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK. The scheme is administered within a trust which is legally separate from the company. Trustees are appointed by both the company and the scheme's membership and act in the interest of the scheme and all relevant stakeholders, including the members and the company. The trustees are also responsible for the investment of the scheme's assets.

Existing members accrue an annual pension of 1/60th or 1/80th (depending on category) of finalsalary for each year of pensionable service, increasing in line with inflation whilst in payment. On the death of an active member the scheme provides the widow(er) a lump sum and a spouse's pension. Members who leave service before retirement are entitled to a deferred pension.

Active members of the scheme pay contributions at the rate of either 7.5% or 6% of salary depending on category and the company pays the balance of the cost as determined by regular actuarial valuations.

The scheme poses a number of risks to the company, for example, longevity risk, investment risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and salary risk.The trustees are aware of these risks and use various techniques to control them.The trustees have a number of internal control policies including a risk register, which are in place to manage and monitor the various risks they face.

### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued

### 26. Retirement benefit obligations (continued)

The scheme is subject to regular actuarial valuations, which are usually carried out every three years.These actuarial valuations are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 2004 and so include margins for prudence.This contrasts with these accounting disclosures, which are determined using best estimate assumptions.

The last formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2020. The results of that valuation have been projected forward to 30 June 2022 by a qualified independent actuary. The figures in the following disclosure were measured using the Projected Unit Method.

On 26 October 2018, the High Court reached a judgement in relation to Lloyds Banking Group's defined benefit pension schemes which concluded that schemes should equalise pension benefits for men and women as regards guaranteed minimum pension benefits. The impact of this judgement on the scheme has been estimated and included in the pension liability.

At the end of the reporting period the scheme was in surplus as measured under the principles of IAS19. Under the accounting standard an entity is allowed to recognise a pension scheme surplus on its balance sheet to the extent that it is able to realise an economic benefit from that surplus.

The directors have reviewed the rules of the scheme and have concluded that the company can gain full economic benefit from the scheme on the basis that the rules provide it access to any surplus after the last member has no further benefits in the scheme (referred to in the standard as gradual settlement). Furthermore,the rules are such that the trustees are not able to take any actions that would reduce the accounting surplus, such as benefit augmentations or triggering a scheme wind-up, without the company's action or consent.

| 24.9 years | 24.8 years |
|            |            |

The sensitivities of the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are as follows:

| Change in assumption | Impact on scheme liabilities |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Decrease by 0.1%     | Increase by £0.8m            |
| Increase by 0.1%     | Increase by £0.5m            |
| Increase by 1 year   | Increase by £2.7m            |
|                      |                              |

The sensitivities may not be representative of the actual change in the present value of the scheme obligations, as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of each other, as the assumptions may be linked.

### 29. Derivative financial instruments

The group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity concerned. The currencies giving rise to this risk are various, but the most significant are the US Dollar and the Euro. Forward exchange contracts are used to manage this exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.

The group hedges, using forward exchange contracts, transactions denominated in a foreign currency which are not matched against other transactions in the same currency within the group.The forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.

The group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. The hedged cash flows are expected to occur within one year after the balance sheet date.

The fair values have been calculated by applying (where relevant), for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date.

Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts for which no hedge accounting is applied or where the hedge is considered ineffective are recognised in the income statement.

Other than the use of forward exchange contracts as detailed above, the group does not make use of derivative financial instruments.

### 30. Financial instruments

For cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables and receivables the fair value approximates to their book value due to the short maturity profile of these financial instruments. On receivables, allowances are made within the book value for credit risk.The fair value of forward exchange contractsis determined by reference to spot rates adjusted for the forward pointsto the contract value date.

The book values and fair values of financial instruments are set out below:

Other than forward exchange contracts which are categorised as derivative instruments, all financial assets are categorised as financial assets measured at amortised cost and all financial liabilities are categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value. IFRS 7 requires that these be grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.All items in the table below are categorised as Level 2 which, as defined by IFRS 7, refers to those items whose fair value measurement is derived from inputs other than that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.

#### Sensitivity analysis

The group's principal exposures in relation to market risks are to changes in the euro exchange rate against sterling and to changes in UK interest rates. The group does not fix the interest rate receivable on its sterling balances, and based on balances held at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in sterling interest rates would lead to an increase or decrease in post-tax earnings of £239,000 (2021: £523,000). The table below details the notional impact of changes in the euro exchange rate against sterling on the group's post-tax profit and equity. The gains and losses arise from the translation of receivables, payables, cash and forward exchange contracts which are denominated in currencies other than each subsidiary's reporting currency.

## Notes to the Company Financial Statements

### 1. Accounting policies

#### Basis of preparation

The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.

The company has used the disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 in relation to presentation of a cash flow statement, comparative information for certain assets, capital management, transactions with other group companies, compensation of key management personnel and the effects of new but not yet effective IFRS.

As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the company has used the disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101 in relation to share based payments, and financial instruments. The disclosures for the defined benefit retirement obligations are included in the consolidated financial statements.

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.

The statement on going concern in the consolidated financial statements also justifies the going concern basis used for the company financial statements.

The accounting policies of the company are the same as those set out in the consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting estimates and judgements are income taxes and retirement benefit obligations as set out in the consolidated financial statements.

The following additional accounting policies are specific to the company's financial statements.

#### Investments

Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.

#### Investment land and buildings

Investment land and buildings are stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is calculated to write off the buildings on a straight line basis over their estimated economic life of fifty years. No depreciation is charged in respect of land.

#### Group debtors

Amounts owed by group undertakings are stated after any provision for expected credit loss in line with the three stage model in IFRS 9.

| Total allotted, issued and fully paid             |             |             | 20,997 | 10,568 |

The ordinary shares of 5p each were issued during the year for a consideration of £823,000 (2021: £51,000).

The issued share capital was increased by a bonus issue of one fully paid ordinary share for each fully paid ordinary share held on the register at 14 January 2022.

Shareholders approved a proposal for the return of capital ("return of capital") at an extraordinary general meeting on 6 December 2004. This resulted in the creation of the 1 pence B ordinary shares ("B shares"), which were issued on 14 January 2005. Following the issue of the B shares, holders received a single dividend of 60 pence per B share. The B shares are not listed, have extremely limited rights and are of negligible value.

The preference shares detailed below are included as financial instruments within creditors.

### Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued

### 11. Share capital (continued)

The 5.5% cumulative preference shares of £1 shall confer on the holders thereof the right to receive in priority to all other shares in the capital of the company out of the profits of the company which it shall be determined to distribute, a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 5.5% per annum on the capital for the time being paid up thereon and the right in the event of a winding up, in priority to all other shares in the capital of the company, to repayment of the capital paid up thereon together with a premium of 5p per share and a sum equivalent to any arrears and accruals of the said fixed cumulative preferential dividend thereon (whether earned or declared or not) calculated up to the date of such repayment of capital but shall not confer any further right to participate in profits or assets of James Halstead plc.

The company shall not be at liberty to create or issue any further shares ranking in priority to or *pari passu* with the preference shares without the consent in writing of the holders of three-fourths of the issued preference shares or the sanction of an extraordinary resolution of the holders of such preference shares passed at a separate general meeting of such holders. The preference shares shall not confer upon the holders thereof the right to attend or vote at any general meeting of the company or to receive notice thereof, unless either:

(i) At the date of the notice convening the meeting the fixed cumulative preferential dividend on the preference shares is six months in arrears and then so long only as such dividend shall remain unpaid, and so that for this purpose the dividend on the preference shares shall be deemed to accrue due and be payable by equal half-yearly instalments on 30 June and 31 December in every year, or

(ii) The business of the meeting includes the consideration of a resolution for reducing the capital or winding up the company or for the sale of its undertaking or of any resolution directly abrogating or varying any of the special rights or privileges attached to the preference shares.

The preference shares shall nevertheless entitle the holders thereof to receive notice of every general meeting. At a general meeting at which the holders of preference shares are entitled to attend and vote, the preference shares shall entitle a holder thereof, or his proxy, to vote only for every preference share held by him.

#### Notes

- 1 At the date of this notice, Covid-19 is still affecting people, although there are no public health restrictions in place. The situation will be continued to be monitored and the right to attend the meeting will be in accordance with the UK Government's guidance in force at the time.
- 2 Preference shareholders are advised that they are not entitled to attend or vote at the annual general meeting.
- 3 You can vote either:
	- i. By logging on to www.signalshares.com and following the instructions. If you experience difficulties in logging in or require assistance, please contact Link Group directly on Tel: 0371 664 0300 (Calls are charged at the standard geographic rate and will vary by provider. Calls outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. Lines are open between 09:00 – 17:30, Monday to Friday excluding public holidays in England and Wales).
	- ii By appointing a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the company. Please consider appointing the Chairman of the AGM as your proxy, with voting instructions, to ensure your vote is counted. You may request a form of proxy directly from the registrars, Link Group using the telephone number above (same call terms and conditions apply). In order for a proxy appointment to be valid a form of proxy must be completed. In each case the form of proxy must be received by Link Group, Central Square, 29 Wellington Street, Leeds, LS1 4DL by 12pm on 29 November 2022.
	- iii By attending the meeting in person at the address and time set out at the beginning of this notice, bringing either your attendance card or other appropriate form of identification so that you can be identified by the company's registrars. It is recommended that you arrive at least 15 minutes before the time appointed for the meeting to begin. To be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the company of the votes they may cast), shareholders must be entered in the register of members of the company at close of business on 29 November 2022.
	- iv. In the case of CREST members, by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service in accordance with the procedures set out below.

{76}------------------------------------------------

- 4 If you return more than one proxy appointment, either by paper or electronic communication, the appointment received last by the Registrar before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence. You are advised to read the terms and conditions of use carefully. Electronic communication facilities are open to all shareholders and those who use them will not be disadvantaged
- 5 CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Meeting (and any adjournment of the Meeting) by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available from www.euroclear.com/site/public/EUI). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 'CREST Proxy Instruction') must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (ID RA10) by 12pm on 29 November 2022. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to mean the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST application host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
- 6 CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
- 7 Any corporation which is a shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a shareholder provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers in relation to the same shares.
- 8 As at 29 September 2022 (being the latest practicable business day prior to the publication of this Notice), the company's ordinary issued share capital consisted of 416,754,052 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the company as at 29 September 2022 were 416,754,052.
- 9 You may not use any electronic address (within the meaning of Section 333(4) of the Companies Act 2006) provided in either this Notice or any related documents (including the form of proxy) to communicate with the company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
- 10 A copy of this Notice, and other information required by Section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, can be found on the company's website at www.jameshalstead.com.
