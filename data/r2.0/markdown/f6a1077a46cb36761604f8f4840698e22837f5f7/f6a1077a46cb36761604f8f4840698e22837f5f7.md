### **Chairman and CEO's Letter**

On behalf of the Board of Aeeris Ltd (ASX: AER), I am pleased to present our Annual Report for the year ending 30 June 2022.

This has been a year of achievement for the Company, measured by outcomes in customer acquisition, increased revenue, and technological gains. Aeeris finished FY22 with 20% growth in year-on-year revenue from ordinary activities.

The Company reported a small loss in FY22 compared to a profit in FY21 due to the continued investment in new staff to drive future growth.

After raising \$1.5M of additional capital in October 2021, the Board is pleased with the investment and outcomes delivered. The additional funds supported new staff hires who assisted in making significant advances in the Company's technology. Aeeris has now successfully migrated its key platform to the cloud, on time and budget with no down time or loss of data. Further, significant technological advances to the Climatics V.2 platform, data analytics, API's and internal management systems have been made.

While some customers use our primary system, the Spatial Analysis Risk Platform (**SARP**), for multi-purpose, multi-channel alerting and communications, many of our customers prefer to consume our data through their own platforms. Over the period we have successfully integrated multiple large enterprises via our API's, delivering spatial alerting and climate data through their own corporate systems.

Marketing, sales systems, monitoring and reporting have been greatly enhanced and the Company is starting to realise these benefits with increased sales.

Our Climatics platform has become a "push button" exercise covering multiple perils. It is a multiuser, scalable application with its own billing system and the Company now has several customers using Climatics.

Our primary platform, SARP, has been in continuous use by water authorities and dam operators as the wet events continue. Northern and eastern Australia is currently experiencing a La Niña weather pattern. Our nation dances between the extremes with the odd interlude of stable climatic conditions. There may well be other contributing factors.

**Recently, researchers calculated that the eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai spewed a staggering 50 million tons (45 million metric tons) of water vapor into the atmosphere. This massive vapor injection increased the amount of moisture in the global stratosphere by about 5%.**

#### **(LIVE SCIENCE) 1**

The extreme events of the last financial year have attracted industries to our services that have not previously been part of our portfolio. These include large retail clients, vehicle manufacturers, repairers, and community services.

The growing appetite among those who invest in Australian companies for the disclosure of climaterelated risks further bolsters our opportunities, particularly for our Climatics product. And it seems likely that Australia may follow other jurisdictions like New Zealand, which have already implemented a mandatory disclosure regime, putting further pressure on companies to assess and disclose climate related risk.

James Eyers reported in the Australian Financial Review that "Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (**APRA**) last month found nearly a quarter of banks, insurers and super funds had no proper metrics to measure and monitor climate risk. APRA considers climate risk could have a compounding impact on credit, market liquidity and operational risk and is keen to see banks develop better data sets to assess exposures.

"APRA has been interrogating the availability and quality of risk data at the largest financial institutions through a Prudential Standard known as CPS 230 on 'operational resilience." 2 This is what we call operationalised data, something granular, location specific and can be acted on versus modelling.

Aeeris is in a unique position to service these requirements as we provide lifesaving, asset protection **and predictive analysis on acute and physical climate risks**, producing useful information and insights for decision makers

We enter FY2023 with a larger more balanced team, enhanced technology assets, a strong balance sheet, no debt and increased resources to scale the business through accelerated revenue growth.

On behalf of the board, I would like to congratulate the Aeeris team responsible for achieving excellent outcomes for the year under difficult conditions.

I would like to thank and welcome the many new customers who have made the choice to support a safer future, and for the strong support from shareholders and our key stakeholders who continue with us on our journey to reduce climate risk and help protect people, assets and operations.

Yours sincerely,

**Kerry Plowright** Chairman & CEO

# **2022 Highlights**

### **Operational Highlights**

During the financial year, Aeeris:

- **Successfully raised \$1.5m**, bolstering its cash position and leaving it well capitalised to chase growth.
- Hired a new **Business Development Manager** and **Senior Developer.**
- **Successfully integrated almost all of its APIs** into a client's disaster management platform.
- **Setup bushfire and weather alerts** to residents of large residential estates southwest of Sydney, now a legal requirement under new planning and development regulations.
- **Supported and helped clients navigate the flooding disasters** seen across Australia's east coast through the provision of its services, including its popular flooding alert product where continual monitoring of remotes sensors and subsequent response have protected many communities.
- **Completed and launched Climatics 2.0**, as well as signing its first customers. The platform allows clients to easily understand the climate risk their assets across Australia are facing and the probability of these events occurring with push button ease.
- **Successful migrated its operational SARP to Microsoft's Azure** cloud platform. The migration was technically challenging, however, was successfully achieved without any data loss or disruption to users. The streamlining of operations to the Cloud will enhance operational performance and achieve some technology cost savings, vastly improving granular control of system performance, scalability and redundancy. This was a crucial step in a generational upgrade to the core system and will provide stability and scalability for the future. Being part of the Microsoft's Azure ecosystem opens new doors to exciting possibilities, allowing the system to be easily adapted for other locations/countries.
- **Produced over 1628 hail alerts** through its Hail product released in FY22.

### **Review of Operations**

![](_page_9_Picture_2.jpeg)

This year, we have added a fully authenticated AWS API gateway around the Climatics solution and have added to the API functionality offering. This is a result of product testing feedback from clients who really wanted to use the API's functionality long term. As we have seen with the recent Optus news, the need to properly secure API interfaces is crucial. The AWS API gateway is enterprise grade security and authentication. Additionally, there will be new work to extend and improve the API underpinning the GIS platform, improving the existing offering and integrating many more relevant data feeds (from partners such as the Bureau of Meteorology) to help clients understand the immediate severe weather landscape and the implications for their assets.

Australia saw more than its fair share of extreme weather events, after undergoing a second consecutive year of La Niña, bringing increased rainfall to Australia's east coast during FY22. The floods experienced along the east coast, as well as other extreme weather events across the country increased enquiries for and use of Aeeris' services.

![](_page_10_Picture_2.jpeg)

Throughout the floods, Aeeris provided customers with detailed threat forecasts, monitoring, alerting and advanced protection of customers' assets. Services provided included the:

- Provision of critical water and dam release information to customers of a major water organisation across southeast QLD and NSW;
- 24/7 monitoring of major rivers and remote sensors, provision of pre-event forecasts and alerts to State Government Agencies, and major rail customers, enabling the safety of assets and staff. This involved 24/7 client briefing meetings with our meteorologists, providing event critical information; and
- Provision of 24/7 rainfall and flood monitoring to councils, removing false alarms and sending time critical alerts to residents before flooding occurred.

FY22 also saw Aeeris successfully deliver and integrate almost all of its available APIs into a customer's disaster management platform; setup bushfire and weather alerts to residents of large residential estates southwest of Sydney, a requirement under new planning and development regulation; experience increased uptake of its hail alerting product and the recent addition of a heatwave alerting system has just been launched.

## **Aeeris Team Active in Saving Lives**

One thing you can guarantee about Australia is that a disaster is nearly always happening somewhere at some time. Floods in one place, catastrophic fires in another, cyclones, droughts, or plate sized hailstones.

All our team in Aeeris have a passion for weather…indeed all hazards. Our team comprises meteorologists, SES volunteers, scientists and storm chasers. Whether on duty or not, they live it every day. The team aren't just observers, they are actively involved in events and fully understand the potential outcomes. This experience helps keep our customers safe. Actionable information is key to any enterprise in potential risk situations, and that is what we deliver – "get out before you get in it."

Following is unedited commentary from our General Manager, James Harris, from when he was involved in the Lismore floods, 28 February 2022.

**Today was an emotional rollercoaster. The confusion at the start of the day as to whether we could take boats down or not. We went out anyway but felt like we should have gone out sooner.**

**Searching streets in a boat that we were literally walking down 24 hours earlier. Hearing cries for help, it became very real. Seeing the joy on people's faces knowing they were safe was incredible. I wanted to cry, but at the same time I felt immense pride watching everyone work together. The boats coming in with rescued people to the left whilst a queue of empty boats on the right heading out for more. Pulling up to the road, volunteers would wade out and help the boat in. We were then met by police, SES and more volunteers all helping the people off the boat and to the paramedics waiting for them. The next few weeks are going to be tough, but after witnessing what I saw today and hearing of so many others volunteering at shelters, catering etc to assist those who have lost everything there is hope!**

{13}------------------------------------------------

# **Aeeris in the Data Age**

Aeeris deals in real world data and real time alerting and forecasting. This, combined with the Company's SARP, arguably delivers the most superior spatial dataset for multiple perils in Australia. Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, summarises the value of such data in a recent study as reported to The Weekend Australian:

**"Climate models are very valuable tools for many applications, but they are not something I want used to decide investment strategies for my superannuation."**

**The central issue is the difference between weather and climate and the inability of models to predict weather events at city scale.**

**Professor Pitman said attempts to use dynamical downscaling to get far higher resolution data was "excellent science but not science designed for the financial sector".**

Previous Aeeris reports expand on the data value, the point here is to catch up to where the market is. A climate risk self-assessment survey published by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority last month found nearly a quarter of banks, insurers and super funds had no proper metrics to measure and monitor climate risk. "Empirical measurement, rather than a subjective judgment, is going to be needed fairly urgently," APRA chairman Wayne Byres said in a speech. The New Zealand government has just made climate risk disclosures mandatory for insurers and banks – the same rules could be imminent in Australia. Insurance Australia Group's (IAG) Ramana James said his company, the biggest general insurer in Australasia, is well prepared.

The combination of a solution and superior data and risk analytics is unique.

One of the strongest features Climatics provides customers is the ability to compare and contrast their assets across Australia and determine locations that may require immediate attention. This kind of analysis across the country is important to help businesses recognise the changes that are being experienced at one location are not necessarily equivalent in other locations and provides them with climate context so they may make informed decisions about the future of their assets.

{14}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)

Flooding across the eastern seaboard in the first half of 2022 has highlighted the need for businesses to be able to assess their flood risk, which is a key component of the offering from Climatics through use of JBA Risk Management Australian flood maps. To date, the data has verified well from events with a positive response from users regarding its ability to identify if an asset will or not as a worst case scenario.

The analysis work focuses on increasing the number of hazards available to users, including adding analysis for sea level, storm surge, lightning, frost and solar energy. This will undoubtedly place Climatics in a unique position in the Climate Risk market by being able to provide climate intelligence for 15+ hazards in a single, easy to use platform that will also be available via an API.

Weather has a direct impact on the performance of a business with a trail of affected service providers and employees. The Construction sector, already under pressure, is a good example of the substantial impact of weather on business. Wet weather forecasts for spring and summer will likely cause more construction delays as the 2022 trifecta of Covid, rain and price escalation continue to take its toll. With the east coast of Australia looking set to experience another La Niña season over the coming six months, this will bring heavy rain and more flooding to communities still in disrepair. Roberts Co chief executive Alison Mirams said it would be a "depressing" outcome after what had already proved to have been a tough year in the construction sector.

![](_page_14_Picture_4.jpeg)

As of July 2022, the commercial builder had lost about 75 workdays this year to wet weather, meaning the business only achieved 46 per cent productivity from January to July.

The recent independent inquiry led by Mick Fuller and Mary O'Kane into the catastrophic Northern Rivers floods found that "many people live on flood plains in NSW, and many of these are in known high-risk areas". If a 19m flood (such as the 1867 record flood) happened in the Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley, more than 90,000 people would need to be evacuated and more than 15,500 homes would flood. The Insurance Council of Australia estimates that since 1970 the total incurred claims from flooding are more than \$21.3bn, with floods in NSW and southeast Queensland in February-March this year costing more than \$3.35bn.

#### **Remuneration Report**

#### **Remuneration Policy**

All key management personnel (including Directors) ("KMP") of Aeeris Ltd were engaged on fixed remuneration consultancy agreements for the provision of services. No performance incentives were issued during the period. The Board of Aeeris Ltd believes, given the size and operations of the Company during the period, that the remuneration policy to be appropriate. All KMP, including Executive Directors, are large shareholders in the Company in their own right, providing them with appropriate incentives for outstanding performance.

All remuneration paid to KMP is valued at the cost to the Company and expensed.

The Board's policy is to remunerate non-executive Directors at market rates for their time, commitment and responsibilities. The Board as a whole determines payments to the non-executive Directors and reviews their remuneration annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice may be sought when required. The maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to non-executive Directors is subject to approval by shareholders at an annual general meeting and is currently \$300,000 per annum

These consolidated financial statements and notes represent those of Aeeris Ltd (the "Company") and Controlled Entities (the "consolidated group" or "Group").

The separate financial statements of the parent entity, Aeeris Ltd, have not been presented within this financial report as permitted by the *Corporations Act 2001*.

The financial statements were authorised for issue on 26 August 2022 by the Directors of the Company.

#### **NOTE 1. Significant Accounting Policies**

#### **Basis of Preparation**

These General Purpose consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the *Corporations Act 2001*, Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The Group is a for-profit entity for financial reporting purposes under Australian Accounting Standards. Material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are presented below and have been consistently applied unless stated otherwise.

Except for the cash flow information, the financial statements, have been prepared on an accruals basis and are based on historical costs, modified, where applicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected noncurrent assets, financial assets and financial liabilities. The amounts presented in the financial statements have been rounded to the nearest dollar.

#### **Going Concern**

The accounts have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and liabilities in the normal course of business.

The Directors are aware that the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, and its ability to pay its debts as and when they fall due, is largely dependent on increases in revenue and successfully managing its short to medium term liquidity position.

#### **COVID-19 Impact Assessment on Going Concern**

The Company enjoys a reliable annuity income stream from blue chip customers. This annuity revenue stream enables it to map and comfortably manage cashflows for the next 12 months without the assumption of any new business.

#### **Principles of Consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate all of the assets, liabilities and results of the parent (Aeeris Ltd) and all of the subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities the parent controls. The parent controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. A list of the subsidiaries is provided in Note 13.

The assets, liabilities and results of all subsidiaries are fully consolidated into the financial statements of the Group from the date on which control is obtained by the Group. The consolidation of a subsidiary is discontinued from the date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between group entities are fully eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed and adjustments made where necessary to ensure uniformity of the accounting policies adopted by the Group.

Business combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses and results in the consolidation of its assets and liabilities.

A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a combination involving entities or businesses under common control. The business combination will be accounted for from the date that control is obtained, whereby the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed are recognised.

When measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination, any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement is also included. Subsequent to initial recognition, contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is remeasured in each reporting period to fair value, recognising any change to fair value in profit or loss, unless the change in value can be identified as existing at acquisition date.

All transaction costs incurred in relation to business combinations, other than those associated with the issue of a financial instrument, are recognised as expenses in profit or loss when incurred.

The acquisition of a business may result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.

#### **Goodwill**

Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the sum of:

- i. The consideration transferred;
- ii. Any non-controlling interest (determined under either the full goodwill or proportionate interest method); and
- iii. The acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest; over the acquisition date fair value of any identifiable assets acquired.

The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for a business combination plus the acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest shall form the cost of the investment in the separate financial statements.

Fair value remeasurements in any pre-existing equity holdings are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Where changes in the value of such equity holdings had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income, such amounts are recycled to profit or loss.

Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in investments in associates.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and is allocated to the Group's cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored and not larger than an operating segment. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity disposed of.

Changes in the ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions and do not affect the carrying amounts of goodwill.

{37}------------------------------------------------

#### **Income Tax**

The income tax expense for the year comprises current income tax expense and deferred tax expense.

Current income tax expense charged to profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income for the current period. Current tax liabilities/(assets) are measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/(recovered from) the relevant taxation authority using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year as well as unused tax losses.

Current and deferred income tax expense is charged or credited directly to equity instead of profit or loss when the tax relates to items that are recognised outside profit or loss.

Except for business combinations, no deferred income tax is recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled and their measurement also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability. With respect to non-depreciable items of property, plant and equipment measured at fair value and items of investment property measured at fair value, the related deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset is measured on the basis that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered entirely through sale.

Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.

Where temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where: (a) a legally enforceable right of set-off exists; and (b) the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended that net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.

#### **Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities**

The Group measures some of its assets and liabilities at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis, depending on the requirements of the applicable Accounting Standard.

Fair value is the price the Group would receive to sell an asset or would have to pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between independent, knowledgeable and willing market participants at the measurement date.

As fair value is a market-based measure, the closest equivalent observable market pricing information is used to determine fair value. Adjustments to market values may be made having regard to the characteristics of the

**AEERIS LTD ABN 18 166 705 595 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022**

Freehold land and buildings are carried at their fair value (being the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction), based on periodic, but at least triennial, valuations by external independent valuers, less accumulated depreciation for buildings.

Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation of land and buildings are credited to a revaluation surplus in equity. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are recognised against revaluation surplus directly in equity; all other decreases are recognised in profit or loss.

Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset.

#### **Plant and Equipment**

Plant and equipment are measured on the cost basis and therefore carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment. In the event the carrying amount of plant and equipment is greater than the estimated recoverable amount, the carrying amount is written down immediately to the estimated recoverable amount and impairment losses are recognised either in profit or loss or as a revaluation decrease if the impairment losses relate to a revalued asset. A formal assessment of recoverable amount is made when impairment indicators are present.

The carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually by Directors to ensure it is not in excess of the recoverable amount from these assets. The recoverable amount is assessed on the basis of the expected net cash flows that will be received from the asset's employment and subsequent disposal. The expected net cash flows have been discounted to their present values in determining recoverable amounts. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the

{39}------------------------------------------------

Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised as expenses in profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

#### **Depreciation**

The depreciable amount of all fixed assets including buildings and capitalised lease assets, but excluding freehold land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the asset's useful life to the consolidated group commencing from the time the asset is held ready for use. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

The depreciation rates used for each class of depreciable assets are:

| Class of Fixed Asset                           | Depreciation Rate |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Plant and equipment                            | 5-33%             |
| Plant and equipment leased to external parties | 10-20%            |

The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. When revalued assets are sold, amounts included in the revaluation surplus relating to that asset are transferred to retained earnings.

#### **Financial Instruments**

#### **Initial Recognition and Measurement**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions to the instrument. For financial assets, this is the date that the entity commits itself to either the purchase or sale of the asset.

Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except where the instrument is classified "at fair value through profit or loss", in which case transaction costs are expensed to profit or loss immediately.

**AEERIS LTD ABN 18 166 705 595 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022**

Financial instruments are subsequently measured at fair value, amortised cost using the effective interest method, or cost.

*Amortised cost* is calculated as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition less principal repayments and any reduction for impairment, and adjusted for any cumulative amortisation of the difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount calculated using the *effective interest method*.

The *effective interest method* is used to allocate interest income or interest expense over the relevant period and is equivalent to the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts (including fees, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) over the expected life (or when this cannot be reliably predicted, the contractual term) of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. Revisions to expected future net cash flows will necessitate an adjustment to the carrying amount with a consequential recognition of an income or expense item in profit or loss.

The Group does not designate any interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as being subject to the requirements of Accounting Standards specifically applicable to financial instruments.

- *i. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss*
Financial assets are classified at "fair value through profit or loss" when they are held for trading for the purpose of short-term profit taking, derivatives not held for hedging purposes, or when they are designated as such to avoid an accounting mismatch or to enable performance evaluation where a group of financial assets is managed by key management personnel on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value with changes in carrying amount being included in profit or loss.

- *ii. Loans and receivables*
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss through the amortisation process and when the financial asset is derecognised.

#### *iii. Held-to-maturity investments*

Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets that have fixed maturities and fixed or determinable payments, and it is the Group's intention to hold these investments to maturity. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss through the amortisation process and when the financial asset is derecognised.

{41}------------------------------------------------

#### *iv. Available-for-sale investments*

Available-for-sale investments are non-derivative financial assets that are either not capable of being classified into other categories of financial assets due to their nature or they are designated as such by management. They comprise investments in the equity of other entities where there is neither a fixed maturity nor fixed or determinable payments.

They are subsequently measured at fair value with any remeasurements other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss pertaining to that asset previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified into profit or loss.

Available-for-sale financial assets are classified as non-current assets when they are not expected to be sold within 12 months after the end of the reporting period. All other available-for-sale financial assets are classified as current assets.

#### *v. Financial liabilities*

Non-derivative financial liabilities other than financial guarantees are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss through the amortisation process and when the financial liability is derecognised.

#### **Impairment**

A financial asset (or a group of financial assets) is deemed to be impaired if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events (a "loss event") having occurred, which has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset(s).

In the case of available-for-sale financial assets, a significant or prolonged decline in the market value of the instrument is considered to constitute a loss event. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss immediately. Also, any cumulative decline in fair value previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss at this point.

In the case of financial assets carried at amortised cost, loss events may include: indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; indications that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; and changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.

For financial assets carried at amortised cost (including loans and receivables), a separate allowance account is used to reduce the carrying amount of financial assets impaired by credit losses. After having taken all possible measures of recovery, if management establishes that the carrying amount cannot be recovered by any means, at that point the written-off amounts are charged to the allowance account or the carrying amount of impaired financial assets is reduced directly if no impairment amount was previously recognised in the allowance account.

The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair value of consideration paid, including the transfer of

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. The assessment will include the consideration of external and internal sources of information, including dividends received from subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures deemed to be out of pre-

acquisition profits. If such an indication exists, an impairment test is carried out on the asset by comparing the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of the asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, to the asset's carrying amount. Any excess of the asset's carrying amount over its recoverable amount is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with

Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receipt of cash flows expire or the asset is transferred to another party whereby the entity no longer has any significant continuing involvement in the risks and benefits associated with the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the related obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the fair value of consideration paid, including the transfer of non-cash assets or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

#### **Impairment of Assets**

At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. The assessment will include the consideration of external and internal sources of information, including dividends received from subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures deemed to be out of preacquisition profits. If such an indication exists, an impairment test is carried out on the asset by comparing the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of the asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, to the asset's carrying amount. Any excess of the asset's carrying amount over its recoverable amount is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with another Standard (e.g. in accordance with the revaluation model in AASB 116: *Property, Plant and Equipment*). Any impairment loss of a revalued asset is treated as a revaluation decrease in accordance with that other Standard.

Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Impairment testing is performed annually for goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives and intangible assets not yet available for use.

#### **Intangibles Other Than Goodwill**

#### **IT Research and Development**

Expenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred. Development costs are capitalised only when technical feasibility studies identify that the project is expected to deliver future economic benefits and these benefits can be measured reliably. IT research and development costs are amortised over 5 years using the prime cost method.

#### **Employee Benefits**

#### **Short-Term Employee Benefits**

Provision is made for the Group's obligation for short-term employee benefits. Short-term employee benefits are benefits (other than termination benefits) that are expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service, including wages, salaries and sick leave. Short-term employee benefits are measured at the (undiscounted) amounts expected to be paid when the obligation is settled.

The Group's obligations for short-term employee benefits such as wages, salaries, superannuation and leave are recognised as a part of current trade and other payables in the statement of financial position.

{43}------------------------------------------------

The Group's obligations for employees' annual leave and long service leave entitlements are recognised as provisions in the statement of financial position.

#### **Other Long-Term Employee Benefits**

At this stage there are no long-term leave entitlements.

#### **Equity-Settled Compensation**

The Group provides compensation benefits to employees (including Directors) of the Group in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares ('equity-settled transactions').

The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by a Black Scholes model. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award ('vesting date').

The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects (i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors of the Company, will ultimately vest. This opinion is formed based on the best available information at balance date. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date.

No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition. Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.

Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.

The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.

#### **Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will result and that outflow can be reliably measured.

Provisions are measured using the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits available on demand with banks, other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are reported within short-term borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

#### **Revenue and Other Income**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable after taking into account any trade discounts and volume rebates allowed. When the inflow of consideration is deferred, it is treated as the provision of financing and is discounted at a rate of interest that is generally accepted in the market for similar arrangements. The difference between the amount initially recognised and the amount ultimately received is interest revenue.

#### **Subscription Income**

Revenue from subscriptions is recognised over the period which the relevant service is provided.

#### **Interest Revenue**

Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest rate method.

#### **Rendering of Services**

Revenue in relation to rendering of services depends on whether the outcome of the services can be measured reliably. If this is the case, then the stage of completion of the service is used to determine the appropriate level of revenue to be recognised in the period. If the outcome cannot be reliably measured, then revenue is recognised to the extent of expenses recognised that are recoverable.

#### **Trade and Other Receivables**

Trade and other receivables include amounts due from customers for goods sold and services performed in the ordinary course of business. Receivables expected to be collected within 12 months of the end of the reporting period are classified as current assets. All other receivables are classified as non-current assets.

Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.

#### **Trade and Other Payables**

Trade and other payables represent the liabilities for goods and services received by the entity that remain unpaid at the end of the reporting period. The balance is recognised as a current liability with the amounts normally paid within 30 days of recognition of the liability.

#### **Goods and Services Tax (GST)**

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.

{45}------------------------------------------------

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are presented as operating cash flows included in receipts from customers or payments to suppliers.

#### **Comparative Figures**

When required by Accounting Standards, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the current financial year.

Where the Group retrospectively applies an accounting policy, makes a retrospective restatement or reclassifies items in its financial statements, an additional (third) statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period in addition to the minimum comparative financial statements is presented.

#### **Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

The Directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial statements based on historical knowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group.

#### **Key Estimates**

#### *Capitalisation of development costs*

Development costs associated with intangible assets are only capitalised by the Group when it can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale, how the asset will generate future economic benefits and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

#### **Key Judgements**

#### *Share-based payment transactions*

The Directors measure the cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date. The fair value is determined by an external valuer using the Black Scholes Model simulation. The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the annual reporting period but may impact expenses and equity.

#### *Revenue*

The Directors have assessed the impact of AASB 15: *Revenue from Contracts with Customers* on the financial statements and have determined that other than unearned revenue, the Group has recognised revenue to depict the transfer of services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the services.

#### *Unearned revenue*

The Directors have assessed the impact of AASB 15: *Revenue from Contracts with Customers* on the financial statements and have determined that unearned revenue reflects the value of consideration that has or will be received before the transfer of services is made to customers.

#### **Credit Risk**

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to any single counterparty or group of counterparties other than those receivables specifically provided for and mentioned within Note 25. The class of assets described as "trade and other receivables" is considered to be the main source of credit risk related to the Group.

The following table details the Group's trade and other receivables exposure to credit risk with ageing analysis and impairment provided for thereon. Amounts are considered as "past due" when the debt has not been settled, with the terms and conditions agreed between the Group and the customer or counterparty to the transaction. Receivables that are past due are assessed for impairment by ascertaining solvency of the debtors and are provided for where there are specific circumstances indicating that the debt may not be fully repaid to the Group.

The balances of receivables that remain within initial trade terms are considered to be of high credit quality.

#### **Annual Leave Provision**

Provision for employee benefits represents amounts accrued for annual leave and long service leave. The current portion for this provision includes the total amount accrued for annual leave entitlements that have vested due to employees having completed the required period of service. Based on past experience, the Group does not expect the full amount of annual leave balances classified as current liabilities to be settled within the next 12 months. However, these amounts must be classified as current liabilities since the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of these amounts in the event employees wish to use their leave entitlement.

#### **Long Service Leave Provision**

The non-current portion for the provision includes the total amount accrued for long service leave entitlements due to employees having completed between 5 to 10 years of service. The Group does not expect the full amount of long service leave balances to be classified as current liabilities until any employees have completed 10 years of service.

#### **Financial Risk Exposures and Management**

The Group has no exposure through financial instruments and therefore has minimal credit risk and liquidity risk. There have been no substantive changes in the types of risks the Group is exposed to, how these risks arise, or the Board's objectives, policies and processes for managing or measuring the risks from the previous period.

#### a) **Credit Risk**

Exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of contract obligations that could lead to a financial loss to the Group.

Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures (such as the utilisation of systems for the approval, granting and renewal of credit limits, regular monitoring of exposures against such limits and monitoring of the financial stability of significant customers and counterparties), ensuring to the extent possible that customers and counterparties to transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for impairment. Depending on the division within the Group, credit terms are generally 30 days from the invoice date.

#### *Credit Risk Exposures*

The maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at the end of the reporting period, excluding the value of any collateral or other security held, is equivalent to the carrying amount and classification of those financial assets (net of any provisions) as presented in the statement of financial position. Credit risk also arises through the provision of financial guarantees, as approved at board level, given to parties securing the liabilities of certain subsidiaries.

{57}------------------------------------------------

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk with any single counterparty or group of counterparties. Details with respect to credit risk of trade and other receivables are provided in Note 12.

Trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered to be of high credit quality. Aggregates of such amounts are detailed in Note 12.

#### b) **Liquidity Risk**

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise meeting its obligations related to financial liabilities. The Group manages this risk through the following mechanisms:

- preparing forward-looking cash flow analysis in relation to its operating, investing and financing activities;
- obtaining funding from a variety of sources;
- maintaining a reputable credit profile;
- managing credit risk related to financial assets;
- only investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and
- comparing the maturity profile of financial liabilities with the realisation profile of financial assets.

Cash flows realised from financial assets reflect management's expectation as to the timing of realisation. Actual timing may therefore differ from that disclosed. The timing of cash flows presented in the table to settle financial liabilities reflects the earliest contractual settlement dates and does not reflect management's expectations that banking facilities will be rolled forward.

#### **NOTE 26. Fair Value Measurements**

The Group does not subsequently measure any liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

#### **Fair Value Hierarchy**

AASB 13: *Fair Value Measurement* requires the disclosure of fair value information by level of the fair value hierarchy, which categorises fair value measurements into one of three possible levels based on the lowest level that an input that is significant to the measurement can be categorised into as follows:

| Level 1                             | Level 2                       | Level 3                              |

| Measurements based on               | other than quoted prices      |                                      |
| quoted prices in active markets     | included in Level 1 that are  |                                      |

The fair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are determined using one or more valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent possible, the use of observable market data. If all significant inputs required to measure fair value are observable, the asset or liability is included in Level 2. If one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the asset or liability is included in Level 3.

{59}------------------------------------------------

#### **Valuation Techniques**

The Group selects a valuation technique that is appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value. The availability of sufficient and relevant data primarily depends on the specific characteristics of the asset or liability being measured. The valuation techniques selected by the Group are consistent with one or more of the following valuation approaches:

- *Market Approach*: valuation techniques that use prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions for identical or similar assets or liabilities
- *Income Approach*: valuation techniques that convert estimated future cash flows or income and expenses into a single discounted present value
- *Cost Approach*: valuation techniques that reflect the current replacement cost of an asset at its current service capacity.

Each valuation technique requires inputs that reflect the assumptions that buyers and sellers would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risks. When selecting a valuation technique, the Group gives priority to those techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. Inputs that are developed using market data (such as publicly available information on actual transactions) and reflect the assumptions that buyers and sellers would generally use when pricing the asset or liability are considered observable, whereas inputs for which market data is not available and therefore are developed using the best information available about such assumptions are considered unobservable.

**Key Audit Matters (continued)**

Following previous operating losses and cash flow deficits, there is a heightened degree of judgement as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern through the assessment period.

Accordingly, we considered the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, the question as to whether there is a material uncertainty and the adequacy of management's disclosure to be a key

We have challenged the key assumptions in management's forecast cash flows for the next 12 months (base case and downside possibilities) by:

#### **Key Audit Matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report forthe year ended 30 June 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

| Key Audit Matter | How Our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter |

#### **Revenue recognition – accuracy of revenue recorded given the complexity of systems**

Revenue represents a material balance and we have identified the following types of transactions and assertions related to revenue recognition which give rise to key risks:

- the completeness of revenue recorded as a result of the reliance on output of the billing systems.
Refer to note 1 – Basis of preparation (Critical accounting estimates and judgments).

In responding to this area of focus, our audit approach included controls testing and substantive procedures covering, in particular:

- testing control procedures in place around systems that bill revenue streams;
- performing tests on the accuracy of customer bill generation on a sample basis and testing of a sample of the credits and discounts applied to enterprise customer bills;
- testing cash receipts for a sample of customers back to the customer invoice;
- testing the costs associated to the delivery of sales; and
- considering COVID-19 impacts to collection of trade receivables.

We also considered the application of the Group's accounting policies to amounts billed.

Based on our work, we noted no significant issues on the accuracy of revenue recorded in the year.

#### **Going Concern**

Following previous operating losses and cash flow deficits, there is a heightened degree of judgement as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern through the assessment period.

Accordingly, we considered the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, the question as to whether there is a material uncertainty and the adequacy of management's disclosure to be a key risk.

We have challenged the key assumptions in management's forecast cash flows for the next 12 months (base case and downside possibilities) by:

- comparing the cash flow forecasts with the Board approved budget, and obtaining explanations for any significant differences;
- ensuring consistency between the forecasts in the group going concern model and those used in the asset value-in-use calculations for impairment assessment purposes;
- assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management;
- testing the mechanical accuracy of the model used;
- performing stress tests for a range of reasonably possible scenarios on management's cash flow for the going concern period;
- challenging management's plans for mitigating any identified exposures, obtain additional sources of financing;
- considering whether the disclosures relating to going concern referred to in the basis of preparation section of the accounting policies are balanced, proportionate and clear; and
- Consider COVID-19 impacts cash flow forecast assumptions.

We have determined that there are no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern.

There were no restrictions on our reporting of Key Audit matters.

#### **Other Information**

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group's annual report for the year ended 30 June 2022, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

#### **Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report**

The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the *Corporations Act 2001* and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

#### **Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
