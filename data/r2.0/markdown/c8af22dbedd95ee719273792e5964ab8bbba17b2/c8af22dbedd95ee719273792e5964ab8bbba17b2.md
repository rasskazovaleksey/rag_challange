^ Return on Invested Capital is impacted in FY22 as only part year contributions from in year acquisitions have been included in the calculation of which the entire debt capital has been used as the denominator. Adjusted ROIC taking in to account annualised contributions from in year acquisitions is 25.5%.

^^ Cash conversion is impacted in FY22 as the initial lockup (WIP & debtors) of the in-year acquisitions reduces the cashflow in the first year. Cash conversion normalised for acquisition lockup is 98.0% (i.e. (Cash from operating activities + debtors from in year acquisitions + accrued income from in year acquisitions)/ EBITDA)).

- * The Group uses owners' earnings to measure cash flow available to the Group. Owners' earnings is a non-IFRS measure which is used to measure cash flow to the Group (after taxes and finance costs) and after taking into account the necessary:
- additions or deductions of working capital investment (debtors, accrued Income, and other accrual movements) required as the business grows and makes acquisitions;
- deductions required for the maintenance capital expenditure for the business to maintain on-going operations in the long term; and
- deducting the repayment of lease liability from cash from operations (which AASB16 reclassifies to cash from financing activities).

In FY22, Owners' earnings for the 12 months were \$13,959,305 (FY21: \$12,807,837) up 9.0% from the prior corresponding period. Owners' earnings for the parent entity were \$6,312,568 (FY21: \$5,041,894), up 25.2% from the prior corresponding period.

- ** Ordinary dividends paid represent the dividends paid relating to the stated financial year. For example, dividends paid in FY22 relating to FY21 is shown in the FY21 column. Dividends shown for FY22 include the estimated final dividends, including special dividends, that will be paid prior to November 2022.
# **Review of operations**

In the year ended 30 June 2022 ('FY22' or '2022'), the Group has recorded a consolidated statutory net profit after income tax from continuing operations of \$13,328,745 (year ended 30 June 2021 ('FY21' or '2021'): \$10,945,476), an increase of 21.8%. The statutory net profit attributable to the members of the parent entity was \$5,565,475 (FY21: \$4,625,330), an increase of 20.3%.

The directors consider Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation ('Underlying EBITDA') and Underlying Net Profit After Tax Before Amortisation ('Underlying NPATA') reflects the core earnings of the Group. Underlying EBITDA and Underlying NPATA are financial measures not prescribed by Australian Accounting Standards ('AAS') and represents the profit under AAS adjusted for non-cash and other items which management consider to be one-off nonrecurring in nature.

Underlying EBITDA and Underlying NPATA are key measurements used by management and the board to assess and review business performance and accordingly the following table provides a reconciliation between profit after income tax expense and Underlying EBITDA.

The following table provides a reconciliation between the NPAT and the Underlying EBITDA of the consolidated Group.

# **COVID-19**

#### **Management response and action**

During the first half of FY22, the Greater Sydney and Melbourne area were subject to lockdown and extensive restrictions as a result of a renewed COVID-19 outbreak. This has led to working from home arrangements being implemented across the Group. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the working from home arrangements, the Group has experienced the following impacts:

- the timing of regular compliance and advisory work being completed has been impacted or delayed where the operating businesses have had to prioritise assisting COVID-19 impacted clients with applying for government grants; and
- the fees charged in relation to assisting COVID-19 impacted clients with applying for government grants are lower and less profitable for the reasons of supporting our clients.

During the COVID-19 outbreak, various operating businesses of the Group satisfied the criteria for JobSaver and the Group received in total \$1,348,189 of COVID-19 government grants. As at 30 June 2022, the JobSaver program has ended. The Group views the government grants received to be one-off non-recurring in nature and has deducted such income from its underlying results for the purposes of looking through the true underlying performance of the business.

Irrespective of the above, the Group continues to grow and operate profitably. The Group continues to monitor the potential impacts and risks posed by the pandemic and focuses heavily on protecting the physical and mental health of its people.

# **Quality shareholders**

During the first half of FY22 the Group continued its Quality Shareholders initiative and was pleased to have William Thorndike (author of '*The Outsiders : Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success'*) and Lawrence Cunningham (author of '*The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America'* and now a Non-Executive Independent Director of the Company from 1 July 2022) speak at our 2021 Annual General Meeting. The Group extends its thanks and appreciation to William and Lawrence for their contributions to cultivating the Group's quality shareholder base. The Group firmly believes that attracting Quality Shareholders, who view themselves as part owners of the business and are willing to invest a meaningful amount of their wealth for a very long time, is critical in achieving the Group's longterm strategy and vision.

# **Financial performance**

# **Acquisitions and integration**

During FY22, the Group has completed acquisitions with estimated total annual revenues in the range of \$11.7m to \$15.2m. Further, the Group has completed one acquisition in July 2022 with estimated total annual revenues in the range of \$3.4m to \$4.2m. In aggregate the Group has completed eight acquisitions with estimated total annual revenues in the range of \$15.1m to \$19.4m, representing 30.9% to 39.7% of FY21 revenue. The Group has well surpassed the \$4.4m target acquisition for FY22 as per the Group's 5-year plan.

The completed acquisitions are listed in the table below.

#### **Offices and partners**

As at 30 June 2022, the Group operated out of 19 offices (30 June 2021: 16). During the year, the Group commenced businesses in three new locations in Newcastle, NSW (Jul-21), Canberra, ACT (Dec-21) and Bendigo, VIC (Apr-22). All of the new office openings were a result of acquisitions of local accounting firms that were completed during the year. We are pleased that 10 of our 19 offices now qualify as a top 100 accounting firm in their own right, commanding dominant market positions in their respective regions. During the year, 6 of our offices underwent or are currently undergoing fitout upgrades. Over the last 2 years, the Group has progressively upgraded the fitouts for each of its 19 offices in order to build a consistent brand and office experience for its people and its clients.

As at 30 June 2022, the total number of equity partners (including the CEO, Brett Kelly) was 62 (30 June 2021: 54) with two partners promoted internally, and eight partners joining the group from completed acquisitions. Post balance date, four partners joined the group from the Hunter Region acquisition, taking the total number of equity partners to 66. The Group continues its focus in admitting and recruiting new partners as part of its strategy to retain and motivate key talents and to drive revenue growth.

#### **Properties**

On 20 December 2021, Kelly Partners (Canberra) Property Trust, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited, purchased a 100% interest in a commercial property located in Kingston ACT for a total consideration of \$2.2m. Kelly Partners Canberra has operated from these premises since April 2022, having completed the acquisitions of two Canberra accounting firms in December 2021 and February 2022. The office is located in a prime location on the Kingston foreshore and will assist the business in building a presence in Canberra.

As detailed in previous commentary, the Group continues to pursue a strategy of removing properties off balance sheet. Nonetheless, the Group still believes that the properties from which its business operate should be owned in a separate structure in which our operating partners can own a share. The Group is currently in the process of considering and establishing such structures to own the properties.

#### **Revenue**

Revenue for FY22 increased 32.6% to \$64,862,110 (FY21: \$48,906,446). A reconciliation of acquisition and organic growth is set out below:

|                                                                                     | \$                                | Growth rate<br>%  |

| Total revenue from acquired businesses                                              | 12,935,813                        | 26.5              |
| FY22 Revenue                                                                        | 64,862,110                        | 32.6              |

Acquired revenue of \$12,935,813 contributed 26.5% of revenue growth, with in year acquisitions completed to date in FY22 contributing \$10,507,605 and revenue from the acquisitions completed in FY21 contributing \$2,428,208.

Organic revenue growth contributed 6.2% of revenue growth and has exceeded the Group's target annual organic growth of 5%.

# **Operating expenses**

Employment and related expenses have increased 42.4% compared to revenue growth of 32.6%. This is due to higher cost of sales and administration staff costs from in year acquisitions and additional team members recruited in the parent entity's central progress team to support the Group's growth. In many of the in year acquisitions, the outgoing vendor also receives a consulting fee for the first 1-2 years post completion to ensure a successful transition of their business and clients to Kelly+Partners. Other expenses have increased 21.1% on prior year.

# **Underlying EBITDA**

Underlying EBITDA (which measures EBITDA before one off and non-recurring items) increased 23.9% to \$23,113,559 (FY21: \$18,653,935).

{10}------------------------------------------------

The directors consider underlying EBITDA margin before AASB 16 as a more meaningful measurement of performance. The underlying EBITDA margin before AASB 16 is slightly lower than the prior year at 30.8% (FY21: 32.6%). The EBITDA margins have been slightly depressed this year due to the large number of acquisitions completed and additional costs initially required to transform the acquired businesses in order to achieve Kelly+Partners benchmark profitability metrics. Our aim is to increase the EBITDA margin to 35.0% and we expect to do so once the recently completed acquisitions have undergone a successful transition and transformation under our Kelly Partners Partner-Owner-DriverTM model.

A reconciliation of Underlying EBITDA before and after the AASB 16 leasing adjustment is set out in the table below.

|                                                                  | FY22<br>\$ | FY21<br>\$                                 | FY20<br>\$ |

# **Additional investment expenditure in the Parent Entity**

Since the IPO, the parent entity has continued to invest in order to further develop the capabilities of the central services team and to enable the business to be positioned for long term growth as well as to increase its competitive advantage. These investments have sometimes exceeded the central Services Fee and IP Fee income that the Company receives from its operating businesses, as shown in the table below.

As communicated in prior financial results releases and announcements, the Company undertook a significant review of its cost structures and additional investment expenditure made during the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020 and committed to reducing the ongoing additional investment spend to be in line with the income it receives from its operating businesses. This focus and review have brought the additional investments expenditure down to \$77,836 for the FY22 year contributing to the uplift in the Underlying attributed NPATA. Investment expenditure continue to be brought in line with the income received from its operating businesses in the current year.

The Company maintains its strategy to continue to improve operational efficiency impact overtime, unless attractive opportunities arise where the Company sees a benefit in committing additional investments expenditure.

# **Non-recurring and one-off items**

Total non-recurring income for the Group for the year was \$2,454,412 (FY21: \$1,380,839) and included:

- 1) \$1,348,189 in one-off government grants in relation to COVID-19;
- 2) \$689,468 in subsidies received through the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program; and
- 3) \$416,755 in non-cash income relating to a change in fair value of contingent consideration. This relates to a completed acquisition in FY20 where the vendor had not achieved the required targets for the payment of the contingent consideration.

{11}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

Total non-recurring expenses for the year of \$778,358 (FY21: \$1,147,340) which included:

- (1) \$292,296 in implementation costs relating to the in-year acquisitions, including but not limited to legal costs, costs to establish financing, costs in relation to migration of databases, transitioning of servers and other IT infrastructure, relocation costs to Kelly+Partners offices, conversion of ledgers and client bases etc. These costs cover the 8 acquisitions completed in FY22.
- (2) \$240,468 in lease, occupancy and termination costs relating to leases inherited as part of the acquisitions completed during the year, including Canberra, Penrith, Narrabeen, Central Coast etc. In all of these leases, the existing team was relocated to an existing Kelly Partners office on completion of the acquisition, rendering the existing premise vacant.
- (3) \$159,212 in lease expenses relating to a lease inherited as part of the Sydney CBD acquisition completed in July 2021. On completion of the acquisition, as part of integrating the acquired business, the existing team was relocated to the Kelly Partners Sydney CBD office, rendering the existing premise vacant. This cost is not expected to recur post the expiration of the existing lease in October 2022, and hence has been excluded from underlying results.
- (4) \$86,381 in redundancy costs relating to restructuring of acquired businesses and other non-recurring expenses.

The Group classifies costs related to acquiring businesses under non-recurring and one-off items on the basis that those specific acquisition costs (related to specific businesses acquired) will not re-occur in future periods whilst their associated revenues and earnings are expected to continue into future periods. As part of its growth strategy, management continue to identify acquisition targets and any future acquisition expenses are expected to be accompanied by future revenues and earnings associated with those expenses. The separate classification of acquisition costs into non-recurring and one-off items provides transparency to look-through to the underlying performance of the Group.

# **Depreciation and amortisation and finance costs**

Depreciation and Amortisation expense increased to \$6,330,126 (FY21: \$4,427,456) and includes depreciation expense of \$3,968,067 (FY21: \$3,352,706) and amortisation expense of \$2,362,059 (FY21: \$1,074,750). The increase in depreciation expenses is due to the recent fitout upgrades as well as an increase number of leases (leading to higher number of 'right-ofuse assets' that need to be depreciated). The increase in amortisation expense is due to recent acquisitions completed creating customer relationship intangible assets that are amortised in accordance with Australian accounting standards.

Finance costs increased to \$2,038,179 (FY21: \$1,550,839). Finance costs include interest on lease liabilities recognised under AASB 16 and the increase is due to new property leases that the Group has entered into as part of acquiring businesses in new locations.

#### **Income tax expense**

|                                                         | 2022         | 2021         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Net profit before income tax from continuing operations | \$16,421,310 | \$12,909,139 |
| % Growth                                                | 27.2%        | 11.6%        |
| Income tax expense                                      | \$3,092,565  | \$1,963,663  |
| % of net profit                                         | 18.8%        | 15.2%        |

The Group's Income Tax Expense has increased to \$3,092,565 (FY21: \$1,963,663), mainly due to an increase in taxable income and an increase in the applicable tax rates. The Group's revenue for FY22 is greater than \$50m, resulting in the Group no longer being eligible as a 'base rate entity'. This has led to an increase in the tax rates to 30% (from 26% in FY21), such that the proportionate increase in the Income Tax Expense is much higher than the increase in Net Profit Before Tax. Note that, as the majority of businesses are structured as partnerships, the income tax expense attributable to the outside interests in these partnerships is not included in the consolidated accounts and therefore the actual tax expense is below the applicable tax rate.

# **Cash flow**

*Cash from operations*

Receipts from customers increased 23.9% to \$66,092,248 (FY21: \$53,359,426). Payments to suppliers and employees increased 28.8% to \$47,559,811 (FY21: \$36,939,488). Operating Cashflow defined as Receipts from Customers less Payments to suppliers and employees) excluding Other Income (which mainly consists of one-off items) was up 12.9% to \$18,532,437.

# **2022 2021**

Operating cashflow \$18,532,437 \$16,419,938 % Growth on prior year 12.9% 2.9%

#### *Cash from investing activities*

In FY22 the Group spent \$6,797,390 on property, plant and equipment capital expenditure. Of this, \$2,093,275 was used to acquire a commercial property in Canberra now occupied by the Kelly Partners Canberra operating business. Amounts totalling \$4,009,103 was used in fitout upgrades completed in the Oran Park, Hunter Region, North Sydney, Western Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne offices. Over the last 2 years, the Group has progressively upgraded the fitouts for each of its 19 offices in order to build a consistent brand and office experience for its people and its clients. The remaining \$695,012 represents office and computer equipment, new motor vehicles and other capital expenditures.

#### *Cash from financing activities*

In FY22 the Group's borrowings (excluding overdrafts considered as working capital) increased significantly by \$15,867,226 or 96.1% to \$32,372,077 (30 June 2021: \$16,504,851). New borrowings of \$23,406,865 were taken out during the year, mainly for the completion of in year acquisitions. The difference reflects the repayments made during the year of \$7,539,639 and reflects the Group's strong and disciplined approach in repaying debt, compared to \$6,426,892 in the prior period, representing an increase of 17.3%. Proceeds from borrowings of \$23,406,865 included \$13,980,301 for acquisition funding, \$2,200,000 for the purchase of the Canberra property, \$3,405,946 for fitout funding, \$1,937,847 for recapitalisation loans, \$601,002 relating to the buy in by two new partners and the remaining \$1,281,771 for insurance premium funding, motor vehicle financing and other uses.

#### **Working capital**

The Group continues to maintain a disciplined approach to managing its lockup (defined as trade receivables and accrued income less contract liabilities), with lockup of 55.8 days or \$11,622,743 (calculated on run rate revenue with annualised revenue contributions from completed acquisitions) compared with the prior year (30 June 2021: 51.1 days, \$6,841,427).

This continues to be a strong result and has been achieved alongside strong acquisition and organic growth. Note that lockup calculated on actual revenue (which is used to calculate lockup) does not include the full 12 months' revenue of the in-year acquisitions. For the purposes of achieving a more meaningful comparison, the lockup based on annualised revenue has been used.

| Accrued income and contract liabilities days | 8.3          | 4.8         |

# **Capital structure**

The business continues to maintain a capital structure that supports its accelerated growth. As at 30 June 2022 the Group's Gearing Ratio (defined as Net Debt / Underlying EBITDA) increased to 1.36x (2021: 0.84x) mainly as a result of debt taken out to complete the acquisitions. The Group does not view the increased gearing ratio as a risk given acquisition debt is amortized and repaid through profits generated from the acquired business and is expected to be repaid in full over a 4-5 year term. Net Debt is a non-IFRS measure and means Total Borrowings less Cash and Cash Equivalents.

|                                              | 2022  | 2021  |

# *Parent entity facilities*

On 7 July 2022, Westpac approved the increase in the parent's revolving line of credit from \$400,000 to \$3,000,000.

Apart from the matters discussed above, no other matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 2022 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the Group's operations, the results of those operations, or the Group's state of affairs in future financial years.

# **Likely developments and expected results of operations**

The Group will continue to pursue its policy of increasing the profitability and market share in the markets within which it operates during the next financial year.

The Group's growth plan is based on a three-pronged strategy: organic growth, network expansion (which includes acquisitions, tuck-ins and greenfields) and the introduction of new services.

# **Economic, environmental and social sustainability risks**

The operations of the Group are not subject to any particular or significant Commonwealth, State or Territory environmental regulations.

Accounting services, which require associated expert advice typically provided by accountants, are important particularly in the case of small and medium enterprises where the complexity of taxation and other compliance requirements are increasing, and therefore it is unlikely that there would be a material risk in relation to economic sustainability. Risks that may arise include rapidity in changes in technology and simplification of tax legislation. The risks in relation to economic sustainability are considered as part of determining strategy and management regularly monitor market developments.

Part of the Group's commitment to managing these risks is ensuring that it has governance systems, structures, values, principles, frameworks and policies to define its decision making context for managing its business sustainably.

# *Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration*

The objective of the Group's executive reward framework is to ensure reward for performance is competitive and appropriate for the results delivered. The framework aligns executive reward with the achievement of strategic objectives and the creation of value for shareholders, and it is considered to conform to the market best practice for the delivery of reward. The Board of Directors ('the Board') ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for good reward governance practices:

- competitiveness and reasonableness;
- acceptability to shareholders;
- performance linkage / alignment of executive compensation; and
- transparency.

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for its directors and executives. The performance of the Group depends on the quality of its directors and executives. The remuneration philosophy is to attract, motivate and retain high performance and high quality personnel.

The reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board has considered that it should seek to enhance shareholders' interests by:

- having economic profit as a core component of plan design;
- focusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering constant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and
- attracting and retaining high calibre executives.

Additionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by:

- rewarding capability and experience;
- reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth; and
- providing a clear structure for earning rewards.

In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of non-executive director and executive director remuneration is separate.

#### *Non-executive directors' remuneration*

Fees and payments to non-executive directors reflect the demands and responsibilities of their role. Non-executive directors' fees and payments are reviewed annually by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee may, from time to time, receive advice from independent remuneration consultants to ensure nonexecutive directors' fees and payments are appropriate and in line with the market.

ASX listing rules require the aggregate non-executive directors' remuneration be determined periodically by a general meeting. A maximum annual aggregate remuneration of \$160,000 is currently in place.

#### *Executive remuneration*

The Group aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of remuneration which has both fixed and variable components.

The executive remuneration and reward framework has four components:

- base pay and non-monetary benefits;
- short-term performance incentives;
- share-based payments; and
- other remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave.

The combination of these comprises the executive's total remuneration.

Fixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, are reviewed annually by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee based on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of the Group and comparable market remunerations.

Executives may receive their fixed remuneration in the form of cash or other benefits (for example motor vehicle benefits) where it does not create any additional costs to the Group and provides additional value to the executive.

# *Employee Incentive Plan ('EIP')*

In December 2019, the Board approved the establishment of the EIP. The EIP is designed to assist in the attraction, motivation, retention and reward of employees by allowing them to participate in the overall success and growth of the Group. The EIP is also designed to align the interests of employees with the interests of shareholders by providing an opportunity for the participants to receive an equity interest in the Company. In FY2022 the EIP Trust purchased 190,023 shares on market for a total of \$797,963 with an average share price of \$4.04. As at 30 June 2022, total shares of 256,112 continue to be held in trust and have not been allocated to any employees.

# *Group performance and link to remuneration*

For the year ended 30 June 2022 there was no link between Group performance and KMP remuneration.

# *Use of remuneration consultants*

During the financial year ended 30 June 2021, the Group engaged Godfrey Remuneration Group ('GRG'), remuneration consultants, to review its existing remuneration policies and provide recommendations on short term incentive ('STI') and long term incentive ('LTI') programs. A total amount of \$49,500 was paid to engage GRG. The Board was satisfied that the remuneration recommendation received was free from undue influence by members of the KMP to whom the recommendation relates, because of strict protocols observed and complied with regarding any interaction between GRG and management, and because all remuneration advice was provided to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. At the date of the report, no recommendations have been implemented.

*Voting and comments made at the Company's 2021 Annual General Meeting ('AGM')* The motion was put to a poll at the AGM and was carried.

#### **Non-audit services**

Details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor for non-audit services provided during the financial year by the auditor are outlined in note 32 to the financial statements.

The directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the financial year, by the auditor (or by another person or firm on the auditor's behalf), is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001.

The directors are of the opinion that the services as disclosed in note 32 to the financial statements do not compromise the external auditor's independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:

- all non-audit services have been reviewed and approved to ensure that they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and
- none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) issued by the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board, including reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decisionmaking capacity for the Company, acting as advocate for the Company or jointly sharing economic risks and rewards.

# <span id="page-32-0"></span>**Note 1. General information**

The financial statements cover Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited (the 'Company' or 'parent entity') and its controlled entities as a consolidated entity consisting of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited and the entities (the 'Group') it controlled at the end of, or during, the year. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited and its controlled entities functional and presentation currency.

Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited is a listed public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its registered office and principal place of business is:

Level 8, 32 Walker Street North Sydney NSW 2060

A description of the nature of the Group's operations and its principal activities are included in the directors' report, which is not part of the financial statements.

The financial statements were authorised for issue, in accordance with a resolution of directors, on 1 August 2022. The directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.

# **Note 2. Significant accounting policies**

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

# **New or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted**

The Group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards, amendments and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current reporting period.

Any new or amended Accounting Standards, amendments or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.

#### **Basis of preparation**

These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate for for-profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').

#### *Historical cost convention*

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.

#### *Critical accounting estimates*

The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.

#### **Parent entity information**

In accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the Group only. Supplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 36.

# **Principles of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.

Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

{33}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_33_Picture_1.jpeg)

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration transferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interests acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Group. Losses incurred by the Group are attributed to the non-controlling interests in full, even if that results in a deficit balance.

Where the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interests in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The Group recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in profit or loss.

# **Operating segments**

Operating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM'). The CODM is responsible for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.

# **Foreign currency translation**

# *Foreign currency transactions*

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the entity's functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.

# *Foreign operations*

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.

The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.

# **Revenue recognition**

The Group recognises revenue as follows:

#### *Revenue from contracts with customers*

Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the Group: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised.

{34}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_34_Picture_1.jpeg)

# **Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

Variable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are initially recognised as deferred revenue in the form of a separate refund liability.

# *Provision of services*

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time as the services are rendered based on either a fixed price or an hourly rate.

# *Commissions and other income*

Commissions and other income is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive the payment is established.

# **Government grants**

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in profit or loss over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.

#### **Income tax**

The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable.

An income tax benefit will arise for the financial year where an income tax loss is incurred and, where permitted to do so, is carried-back against a qualifying prior period's tax payable to generate a refundable tax offset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for:

- when the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or
- when the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously.

Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate taxpayer within group' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group.

In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group.

{35}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_35_Picture_1.jpeg)

Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the intercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a contribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.

#### **Discontinued operations**

A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately on the face of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

## **Current and non-current classification**

Assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.

An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

#### **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the statement of cash flows presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts, which are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of financial position.

#### **Trade and other receivables**

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement immediately.

The Group has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days overdue.

#### **Accrued income and contract liabilities**

An accrued income asset arises where the Group has performed by transferring goods or services to a customer prior to the receipt of consideration from the customer or prior to payment becoming due and represents the Group's right to consideration for the transferred good or service.

Contract liabilities represent the Group's obligation to transfer services to a customer and are recognised when a customer pays consideration, or when the Group recognises a receivable to reflect its unconditional right to consideration (whichever is earlier) before the Group has transferred the services to the customer.

When a customer pays in advance, the amount received by the Group is recognised as a contract liability until the service has been provided to the customer.

#### **Property, plant and equipment**

Plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

{36}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_36_Picture_1.jpeg)

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment over their expected useful lives as follows:

| Buildings              | 40 years   |
|------------------------|------------|
| Leasehold improvements | 3-10 years |
| Plant and equipment    | 3-7 years  |
| Motor vehicles         | 8 years    |

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the Group. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss.

#### **Right-of-use assets**

A right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the cost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring the site or asset.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.

The Group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred.

#### **Intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, other than goodwill, are initially measured at their fair value at the date of the acquisition. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost. Indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised and are subsequently measured at cost less any impairment. Finite life intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less amortisation and any impairment. The gains or losses recognised in profit or loss arising from the derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the intangible asset. The method and useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually. Changes in the expected pattern of consumption or useful life are accounted for prospectively by changing the amortisation method or period.

# *Goodwill*

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to profit or loss and are not subsequently reversed.

#### *Brand names and intellectual property*

Brand names and intellectual property have indefinite useful lives and are not amortised.

#### *Customer relationships*

Customer contracts acquired in a business combination are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite life of 3 to 7 years.

#### *Software - Computer software*

Significant costs associated with computer software are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite life of 3 years.

{37}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_37_Picture_1.jpeg)

# **Impairment of non-financial assets**

Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other nonfinancial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.

Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit.

#### **Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature they are measured at amortised cost and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.

#### **Borrowings**

Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Where there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date, the loans and borrowings are classified as non-current.

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss as other income or finance costs.

#### **Lease liabilities**

A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties.

The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Variable lease payments include rent concessions in the form of rent forgiveness or a waiver as a direct consequence of COVID-19 and which relate to payments originally due on or before 30 June 2022.

Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.

#### **Group as a lessor**

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

Leases in which the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an asset are classified as a finance lease, where the asset is recognised on the statement of financial position and presented as a lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. The interest rate implicit in the lease is used to measure the net investment in the lease. Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the net investment in the lease.

#### **Finance costs**

All finance costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

{38}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_38_Picture_1.jpeg)

# **Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate specific to the liability. The increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

#### **Employee benefits**

#### *Short-term employee benefits*

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.

# *Other long-term employee benefits*

The liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

#### *Equity-settled compensation*

Equity-settled compensation benefits are provided to employees.

Equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering of services.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period.

#### **Fair value measurement**

When an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.

Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are those that are appropriate in the circumstances and which maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified into three levels, using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. Classifications are reviewed at each reporting date and transfers between levels are determined based on a reassessment of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

For recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, external valuers may be used when internal expertise is either not available or when the valuation is deemed to be significant. External valuers are selected based on market knowledge and reputation. Where there is a significant change in fair value of an asset or liability from one period to another, an analysis is undertaken, which includes a verification of the major inputs applied in the latest valuation and a comparison, where applicable, with external sources of data.

#### **Issued capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

{39}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_39_Picture_1.jpeg)

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

# **Share buy-back**

Where any group company purchases the Company's equity instruments, for example as the result of a share buy-back or a share-based payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited.

# **Dividends**

Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Company, on or before the end of the financial year but not distributed at the reporting date.

# **Business combinations**

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired.

The consideration transferred is the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the non-controlling interests in the acquiree is measured at either fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred to profit or loss.

On the acquisition of a business, the Group assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic conditions, the Group's operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions in existence at the acquisition-date.

Where the business combination is achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at the acquisition-date fair value and the difference between the fair value and the previous carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.

Contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at the acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The difference between the acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any pre-existing investment in the acquiree is recognised as goodwill. If the consideration transferred and the pre-existing fair value is less than the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, being a bargain purchase to the acquirer, the difference is recognised as a gain directly in profit or loss by the acquirer on the acquisition-date, but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired, the non-controlling interests in the acquiree, if any, the consideration transferred and the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquirer.

Business combinations are initially accounted for on a provisional basis. The acquirer retrospectively adjusts the provisional amounts recognised and also recognises additional assets or liabilities during the measurement period, based on new information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition-date. The measurement period ends on either the earlier of (i) 12 months from the date of the acquisition or (ii) when the acquirer receives all the information possible to determine fair value.

# **Earnings per share**

# *Basic earnings per share*

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Kelly Partners Group Holdings Limited, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year.

{40}------------------------------------------------

# *Diluted earnings per share*

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.

# **Goods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes**

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of financial position.

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows.

Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.

#### **New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted**

Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the Group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2022. The Group has not yet assessed the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations.

# **Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are discussed below.

# *COVID-19*

Judgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that COVID-19 has had, or may have, on the Group based on known information. This consideration extends to the nature of the products and services offered, customers, supply chain, staffing and geographic regions in which the Group operates. Other than as addressed in specific notes, there does not currently appear to be either any significant impact upon the financial statements or any significant uncertainties with respect to events or conditions which may impact the Group unfavourably as at the reporting date or subsequently as a result of COVID-19.

# *Allowance for expected credit losses*

The allowance for expected credit losses assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based on the lifetime expected credit loss, grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and on days overdue, and makes assumptions to allocate an overall expected credit loss rate for each group. These assumptions include past default experience of the debtor profile and an assessment of the historical loss rates.

# *Accrued income*

An accrued income asset arises where the Group has performed by transferring goods or services to a customer prior to the receipt of consideration from the customer and represents the Group's right to consideration for the transferred good or service. While assessing the accrued income balance, a degree of estimation needs to be applied on its recoverability and the assessment is primarily based on the Operating Business Owner's professional judgement on the proportionate completion of the performance obligations in comparison to the transaction price stated in the contract .

# **Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)**

# *Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets*

The Group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, whether goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets have suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of assumptions, including estimated discount rates based on the current cost of capital and growth rates of the estimated future cash flows.

#### *Lease term*

The lease term is a significant component in the measurement of both the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Judgement is exercised in determining whether there is reasonable certainty that an option to extend the lease or purchase the underlying asset will be exercised, or an option to terminate the lease will not be exercised, when ascertaining the periods to be included in the lease term. In determining the lease term, all facts and circumstances that create an economical incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option, are considered at the lease commencement date. Factors considered may include the importance of the asset to the Group's operations; comparison of terms and conditions to prevailing market rates; incurrence of significant penalties; existence of significant leasehold improvements; and the costs and disruption to replace the asset. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option, if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances.

# *Incremental borrowing rate*

Where the interest rate implicit in a lease cannot be readily determined, an incremental borrowing rate is estimated to discount future lease payments to measure the present value of the lease liability at the lease commencement date. Such a rate is based on what the Group estimates it would have to pay a third party to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset, with similar terms, security and economic environment.

# *Business combinations*

As discussed in note 2, business combinations are initially accounted for on a provisional basis. The fair value of assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are initially estimated by the Group taking into consideration all available information at the reporting date. Fair value adjustments on the finalisation of the business combination accounting is retrospective, where applicable, to the period the combination occurred and may have an impact on the assets and liabilities, depreciation and amortisation reported.

# **Note 4. Operating segments**

The Group is organised into two reportable segments: (1) Accounting and (2) Other services.

The principal products and services of each of these operating segments are as follows: Accounting Accounting and taxation services, corporate secretarial, outsourced CFO, audits, business structuring, bookkeeping, and all other accounting related services. Other services Financial broking services, wealth management, investment office and all other nonaccounting services.

The operating segments are based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (who are identified as the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM')) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources.

The CODM reviews EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). The accounting policies adopted for internal reporting to the CODM are consistent with those adopted in the financial statements.

As the majority of operating businesses are structured as partnerships, the income tax expense attributable to the noncontrolling interests in these partnerships is not included in the consolidated accounts. This is with the exception of subsidiaries that are in a corporate structure where the consolidated income tax expense is included in the profit attributable to non-controlling interests in these subsidiaries. The remaining balance of the consolidated income tax expense is included in the profit attributable to the shareholders in the parent entity.

The Group has adopted a lifetime expected loss allowance in estimating expected credit losses to trade receivables through the use of a provisions matrix using fixed rates of credit loss provisioning. These provisions are considered representative across all customers of the Group based on recent sales experience, historical collection rates and forward-looking information that is available.

<span id="page-49-1"></span>Loans to partners primarily represents amounts of money which have first been borrowed on the balance sheet of various controlled entities, and then secondly on lent to partners to assist them with their purchase of equity into that entity. This results in the controlled entity having both a financial liability to the financier, and a corresponding financial asset to the partner. These loans are typically repaid over a four to eight year period. As the loans are repaid by the partners and the financial asset amortises, there is a corresponding amortisation in the financial liability. Repayment of these loans is typically from partner equity distributions.

The recoverable amount of each CGU above is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations use cashflow projections over a five year period, based on financial budgets approved by management. These budgets use historical growth rates to project revenue. Costs are calculated taking into account historical gross margins as well as estimated inflation rates over the period which are consistent with inflation rates applicable to the locations in which the CGU operates. With regard to the assessment of the CGU's, management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

The following assumptions were used in the calculations:

|                      |      | Consolidated |  |
|----------------------|------|--------------|--|
|                      | 2022 | 2021         |  |
|                      | %    | %            |  |
| Terminal growth rate | 2.5% | 2.5%         |  |
| Discount rate        | 8.1% | 8.6%         |  |

The discount rate is calculated using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of the Group, taking into account the Group's sources of capital including listed equity, unlisted equity and bank debt.

# **Note 24. Contingent consideration (continued)**

Contingent consideration relates to the fair value of the contingent component of the purchase price of the acquisitions completed in the current and prior period(s).

Contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and has been estimated using a present value approach. The contingent consideration fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash outflows by the discount rate disclosed in note 18. The discount rate is calculated using the weighted average cost of capital ('WACC') of the Group.

A reconciliation of the movement in contingent consideration for the financial year is set out below:

#### *Ordinary shares*

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in any dividends declared and any proceeds attributable to shareholders should the Company be wound up, in proportions that consider both the number of shares held and the extent to which those shares are paid up. The fully paid ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have a limited amount of authorised capital.

On a show of hands every member present at a meeting in person or by proxy shall have one vote and upon a poll each share shall have one vote.

#### *Share buy-back*

On 11 October 2021, the Company announced the continuation of its share buy-back program of up to 5% of the minimum number of Company's shares outstanding in the last 12 months (being a buy-back of up to 2,250,000 shares at 23 September 2020). During the financial year ended 30 June 2022, the Company did not buy-back any shares. At 30 June 2022, 2,250,000 shares are authorised for on-market buy-back.

#### *Capital risk management*

Management controls the capital of the Group in order to maintain acceptable debt to equity and debt to EBITDA ratios, provide the shareholders and partners with adequate returns and ensure that the Group can fund its operations and continue as a going concern. The Group's capital includes ordinary share capital and financial liabilities.

There are no externally imposed capital requirements other than the financial covenants outlined in note 21.

Management effectively manages the Group's capital by assessing the Group's financial risks and adjusting its capital structure in response to changes in these risks and the market. These responses include the management of debt levels, distributions to shareholders and partners and share issues.

There have been no changes to the strategy adopted by management to manage the capital of the Group since the prior year.

# **Note 29. Dividends (continued)**

The above amounts represent the balance of the franking account as at the end of the financial year, adjusted for:

- franking credits that will arise from the payment of the amount of the provision for income tax at the reporting date
- franking debits that will arise from the payment of dividends recognised as a liability at the reporting date
- franking credits that will arise from the receipt of dividends recognised as receivables at the reporting date

#### **Note 30. Financial instruments**

#### *Financial risk management objectives*

The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks through its use of financial instruments: market risk (including interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Group's overall risk management plan seeks to minimise potential adverse effects due to the unpredictability of financial markets.

The Group does not use derivative financial instruments or speculate in financial assets.

Risk management is carried out by senior management under policies approved by the Board of Directors ('the Board'). The policies include identification and analysis of the risk exposure of the Group and appropriate procedures, controls and risk limits. Management identifies and evaluates financial risks within the Group's businesses and reports to the Board on a regular basis.

The Group's financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks, accounts receivable and payable, bank loans and overdrafts, loans to and from subsidiaries, and leases.

#### *Market risk*

#### *Price risk*

The Group is not exposed to any significant market risk in relation to the prices it charges for the provision of professional services.

#### *Interest rate risk*

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as funds are borrowed at floating and fixed rates. Borrowings issued at floating rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.

The Group's policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term financing. At the reporting date, the Group is exposed to changes in market interest rates through its bank borrowings, which are subject to variable interest rates.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity on the net result for the year and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of 1% and -1% (2021: +1% and -1%), with effect from the beginning of the year. These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.

The calculations are based on the financial instruments held at each reporting date. All other variables are held constant.

#### *Credit risk*

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements. The Group does not hold any collateral.

# **Note 30. Financial instruments (continued)**

The Group has adopted a lifetime expected loss allowance in estimating expected credit losses to trade receivables through the use of a provisions matrix using fixed rates of credit loss provisioning. These provisions are considered representative across all customers of the Group based on recent sales experience, historical collection rates and forward-looking information that is available.

Generally, trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators of this include the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan and no active enforcement activity.

# *Liquidity risk*

Liquidity risk arises from the Group's management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.

The Group's policy is to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. The Group maintains cash and available facilities to meet its liquidity requirements for up to a minimum 30-day period.

The Group manages its liquidity needs by carefully monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial liabilities as well as cash-outflows due in day-to-day business.

Liquidity needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day and week-by-week basis, as well as on the basis of a rolling 30-day projection. Long-term liquidity needs for a 180-day and a 360-day periods are identified monthly.

At the reporting date, these reports indicate that the Group expected to have sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances.

The Group's financial liabilities have contractual maturities which are summarised below:

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.
