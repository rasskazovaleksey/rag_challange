#### **Dear Shareholders,**

I am pleased to provide you with the annual report for FY22 and detail the Company's performance across what is now a global enterprise with 11 offices in 8 countries.

BetMakers achieved key milestones as it focussed on maximising revenue growth and executing on transformative deals in line with Australian and international strategic plans.

The Company delivered more than \$90mil in revenue and a positive adjusted EBITDA.

The performance across its three divisions – Global Betting Services, Global Tote and Global Racing Network – showed strong overall growth and re-enforced the position of BetMakers as a leading B2B wagering technology company within the global landscape.

The further development of proprietary technologies to service the global racing industry – including wagering operators and racing bodies – has been supported by a targeted recruitment of key personnel for management and the Board.

We now have almost 500 staff worldwide and hold 45 regulatory licences to operate in more than 30 countries with over 60 wagering operators and 225 racing partner clients.

In establishing this world-class team across a wide international footprint, and together with the deals signed in FY22, I am especially pleased with the position it now places BetMakers to accelerate growth opportunities in each of its revenue divisions in FY23 and beyond.

### **FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**

The Company reported revenues of \$91.6mil for FY2022, representing revenue growth of 371% compared with the previous year. The Company has also reported adjusted EBITDA of +\$2.2mil.

The growth was largely driven by the expansion of the Company's Platform and Managed Trading Services offering under the Global Betting Services division; the expansion of content distribution rights and delivery to licensed wagering operators under its Global Racing Network division; and the full year recognition of revenues associated with the acquisition of the racing and digital assets acquired from Sportech PLC on 17 June 2021 as a part of the Global Tote division.

Finishing the year with an annualised run-rate revenue in excess of \$100 million1 places the Company in a strong position for future growth.

## **PEOPLE**

In FY22, BetMakers invested in the development and growth of its team and will start the new year with almost 500 employees.

The culmination of this growth in talented people across geographies has given the Company the ability to successfully execute on the foundations that have been built – and the deals that have been executed – over the past number of years.

Key appointments for FY22 included the addition of two new Board members, Rebekah Giles and Anna Massion. These appointments were made in line with BetMakers' intentions to ensure highest levels of governance with a board composition that is diverse in its skillset and is aligned with the Company's global strategy.

During the year, the Company appointed former Caesars senior executive Christian Stuart to the key role of Chief Executive Officer of North America to help drive opportunities throughout this important market.

In addition, BetMakers also added to its Key Executive team across Legal and Technology with the appointments of former Racing Queensland Acting CEO Sam Adams (Chief Legal Officer) and highly experienced wagering executive Dan McDonald (Chief Digital Officer).

## **KEY DEALS**

Throughout FY22 we have focused on executing and delivering key strategic deals that we believe will set the company up for success next year.

Some of those key deals include:

- Executed agreement to be the exclusive technology provider to the NTD consortium, with potential revenues in excess of \$300m over 10 years;
- Launched 12 additional platforms in the Australian market;
- Executed a further 8 platform agreements across Australia, US, and Canada which are due to launch this year;
- Executed an amended agreement with the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen Association extending the term for BetMakers to exclusively manage fixed odds betting on thoroughbred horse racing in New Jersey.
- Expanded our North American content to more than 12,000 races annually to distribute into international jurisdictions and throughout the BetMakers network of clients;
- Executed a binding Heads of Agreement to become the exclusive provider of pari-mutuel betting racing services to Caesars Entertainment Inc. brick-and-mortar retail sportsbook locations in Nevada;
- Selected as the new tote and technology and services provider for the country of Norway under a 10-year agreement relating to the provision of wager processing services with Norsk Rikstoto;
- Extended Parimutuel services agreement with Monmouth Park for a further 5 years.

In the United States, the Company has successfully launched Fixed Odds betting in the state of New Jersey, with the first bets being placed on track in May 2022.

### **FY 23 GROWTH / EXPECTATION**

The outlook for FY23 and beyond is exciting as we focus on executing the Company strategy and realising the multiple growth opportunities our unique set of assets provide.

While a number of these deals have been signed in FY22, we anticipate the benefits will only start to flow throughout FY23 and beyond as these deals materialise.

We believe the business transformation is now unquestionably robust and independent of any single contract or strategy.

This financial year closes with confidence, enthusiasm, and a substantial pipeline of opportunities.

We would not be in this position without the valued support of our shareholders, our dedicated board, and every individual staff member globally, and for that we are truly thankful.

We look forward to continuing to work with each of you to make a positive and significant impact over the next 12 months.

#### *Share-based payments expense*

The group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees and third parties by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The relating expense is then recognised over the period in which the relating services are expected to be rendered. A summary of the FY2022 share-based payment expense is detailed below:

1 On 17 February 2021, the Group announced that it had entered into an exclusive agreement with Mr Matt Tripp to become a strategic advisor. As part of the agreement, Mr Tripp was awarded performance rights that vest upon the Group entering 'Strategic' and/or 'Transformational' transactions as defined under the agreement. The conditions of a 'Strategic' transaction were met as part of the company entering into the NTD consortium technology deal, and therefore 35,000,000 performance rights vested. The associated share-based payments expense was accelerated and recognised in FY2022. There is no further share-based payments expense in relation to the 'Strategic' deal to be recognised in future periods.

2 On 28 January 2020, the Group announced that it had signed conditional commercial agreements with the Waterhouse Group to build and operate new wagering products. As part of the commercial agreements, the Group agreed to issue performance rights (convertible into options) to Waterhouse VC. Based on the terms of the agreement, the company expects

to issue 60,176,765 shares in relation to FY2022 and has therefore recognised an expense of \$12,456,590 for the period. No further expense in relation to the Waterhouse VC commercial agreements is expected in future periods.

3 As approved at the 26 April 2021 General Meeting, Mr Todd Buckingham was awarded 25,000,000 performance rights that vest based on performance and term of service conditions. The share-based payment expense in relation to these performance rights is recognised over the expected life of the performance rights.

## *FY2022 Operational Highlights*

BetMakers is a leading B2B technology company servicing the global racing and online sports betting industries. The Group is defined through four divisions; Corporate, Global Betting Services, Global Racing Network and Global Tote. The company achieved revenues for the year of \$91,682,000, an increase of 371% compared to the prior year (2021: \$19,458,000). This growth was driven by:

- The expansion of the company's platform and managed trading services offering in the Australian market;
- The acquisition of the racing and digital assets acquired from Sportech PLC. The acquisition completed on 16 June 2021, and therefore FY2022 recognised a full year of results from these assets; and

## **Principle Risks**

Identifying and mitigating business risks that may affect the Group's strategy and financial performance is an essential part of the governance framework. This section outlines some of the key risks identified by the Group. They are not listed in order or importance or likelihood to materialise.

Risk Area Description *Licensing and Regulatory*

*Software*

The Group operates in heavily regulated industries and jurisdictions. Accordingly, there is an exposure to a range of risks relating to compliance with, changes to, or uncertainty in, the relevant legal and regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions. Changes to laws and regulations or failure to comply may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position and prospects, or lead to license suspension or cancellation.

The Group's contracts with customers may require approval or consent of one or more Australian or foreign governments, gambling regulators or other regulators. There is a risk that such approval or consent may not be granted and, in such circumstances, the Group or the customer may become unable to comply with contractual obligations, potentially having a material adverse impact on financial performance.

*Technology and*  The Group's business is based largely on the software, source code, technology and computer programs which comprise of its online wagering platforms. There is a risk that this technology and/or software may be superseded or displaced in the market by new technology offerings or software which customers perceive have advantages over the Group's offerings. Furthermore, the Group's systems can be affected by numerous factors including but not limited to data losses, computer system faults, failure of or suspension from key data feeds, data network failures, and catastrophic event such as natural disaster, computer viruses of power failure.

*Intellectual Property and Obligations* There is a risk that failure or inability to protect intellectual property rights may have a significant adverse effect on operations, financial performance and competitive advantage. Further, there is a risk that operations, products, services or platforms may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. If any claim or litigation is brought against the Group which alleges an infringement on another party's intellectual property rights, this could result in the Group being subject to significant liability for damages or losing the right to use the intellectual property. For personal use only

*Security Software, Technology Breaches and Improper Access to Personal Data*

*Reliance on Agreements with Sports and Racing Controlling Bodies*

By their nature, information technology systems are susceptible to cyber-attacks with third parties seeking unauthorised access to data, networks, systems and databases. Further, third party suppliers may receive and store information from the Group or its customers and although this information is limited and subject to confidentiality obligations, if third party suppliers fail to adopt or adhere to robust security practices, any such information may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.

The Group has in place various approvals and authorities granted by racing controlling bodies which permits the publishing and/or use of relevant race field information associated with those racing controlling bodies. There is a requirement to comply with certain terms and conditions, provisions, rules and regulations provided under the relevant State/Territory laws. Under such legislation, rules and regulations, the racing controlling bodies have the discretion to determine the types of bets the Group is permitted to take. A removal of one or more of these bet types may materially adversely affect business operations and financial position.

{11}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

*Racing and Sports Products* The Group is reliant on various state and international racing and sporting controlling bodies providing a regular program of events for the purposes of wagering. A significant reduction in the number of race meetings or sporting fixtures, or the occurrence of an event which impacts adversely on the Australian Racing or Sport industries, or which otherwise disrupts the scheduled racing or sporting program, may have an adverse effect on operational and financial performance.

*Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (CTF)* Under the Group's licenses, there is a requirement to comply with several obligations under the AML/CTF Act including, for example, requirements to develop and implement an AML/CTF program, conduct customer due diligence and report suspect matters and transactions to the Australian regulator, AUSTRAC. Failure to adequately monitor and mitigate against money laundering and other fraudulent activities, or failure to comply with obligations under the AML/CTF Act may result in civil or criminal liability for the Group.

## **Dividends**

There were no dividends paid, recommended or declared during the current or previous financial year.

## **Significant Changes in the State of Affairs**

On 16 July 2021, the Group issued 34,564,921 shares to Waterhouse VC Pty Ltd. For the period 22 May 2020 through to 30 June 2021, the Group recorded relevant revenues of \$6,221,685.70 under the conditional commercial agreements with the Waterhouse Group. As a result, the Class A Performance Rights issued to Waterhouse VC Pty Ltd vested and was converted into 34,564,921 options exercisable into ordinary shares in the Group with an exercise price of \$0.18. Waterhouse VC elected to exercise all options.

Further, on 31 January 2022, the Group issued an additional 45,862,414 shares to Waterhouse VC Pty Ltd. Under the conditional commercial agreements with Waterhouse Group, for the period 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021, the Group recorded relevant revenues of \$8,255,234.50. Consequently, the Class A Performance Rights issued to Waterhouse VC Pty Ltd vested and was converted into 45,862,414 options exercisable into ordinary shares in the Group. The exercise price was \$0.18, and Waterhouse VC elected to exercise all options.

Under the conditional commercial agreements with Waterhouse Group, for the period 1 January 2022 to 30 June 2022, sufficient revenues were generated, and it is expected that the Waterhouse VC Class C Performance Right will convert into 14,314,351 options, which are exercisable into shares. There will be no further options available to the Waterhouse Group under the commercial agreements after the final tranche of 14,314,351 options are issued. On 20 May 2022 the company announced that it had signed a deed of termination in respect of the managed trading services agreement with Tarpin Finance Pty Ltd (in association with the Waterhouse Group commercial agreements). As the relationship with Tarpin exceeded expectations and hit key milestones earlier than expected, the parties agreed to conclude the existing managed trading services agreements with the Waterhouse Group on 30 June 2022. For personal use only

There were no other significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the financial year.

## **Matters Subsequent to the End of the Financial Year**

On 12 August 2022 the company announced that it had entered into a deed of variation to amend the contract with NTD Pty Limited to provide technology and services to the new NTD wagering venture. In addition, NTD has agreed to purchase certain assets pertaining to the wagering business owned and operated by O'Shea Bookmaking Pty Ltd (trading as "TexBet") with BetMakers' support. Under the amended terms, the company will increase the Annual Fee payable by NTD to OM Apps by \$2 million per annum, BetMakers will contribute a total of \$2.5 million over two tranches towards the purchase of TexBet by NTD.

No other matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 2022 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the Group's operations, the results of those operations, or the Group's state of affairs in future financial years.

#### **Remuneration Report (Audited)**

The remuneration report, which has been audited, outlines remuneration arrangements for Key Management Personnel ('KMP') of the Group, in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and its regulations. KMP are defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the major activities of the Group, directly or indirectly.

### *Use of Remuneration Consultants*

The Nomination & Remuneration Committee may, from time to time, receive advice from external advisors to guide the Committee and provide relevant market information on the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors and KMP. Any advice received will form part of the Committee's review but will not be used to provide quantum of remuneration packages and/or structure.

During the financial year ended 30 June 2022, the Committee did not receive any remuneration recommendations from a remuneration consultant, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001.

The Group did engage a third-party advisor to perform a review of its existing remuneration policies, including short-term and long-term incentives, as well as remuneration benchmarking for directors and select executive staff. No remuneration recommendations were provided as defined by the Corporations Act 2001.

### *Principles used to Determine the Nature and Amount of Remuneration*

#### *Key Objectives of the Group's Executive Reward Framework*

- Align executive reward with the
	- achievement of strategic objectives and value creation for shareholders'
- Attract, motivate and retain high performance and high-quality executive personnel
	- Deliver transparency and clear structure for executive reward and alignment to shareholders' interest

The Board is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for directors and executives and regularly reviews remuneration arrangements, framework and structure. The framework is considered to conform to market best practice for the delivery of reward; and in accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of Non-Executive and Executive Director remuneration is separate. For personal use only

#### *Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration*

Remuneration to Non-Executive Directors reflects the demands and responsibilities of their role. Non-Executive Directors' remuneration is reviewed annually by the Board. The Chairman's fees are determined independently to the fees of other Non-Executive Directors based on comparative roles in the external market. The Chairman is not present at any discussions relating to the determination of their own remuneration.

ASX listing rules require the aggregate Non-Executive Directors' remuneration be determined periodically by shareholders. The most recent determination was at the AGM held on 22 November 2021, where the shareholders approved that the aggregate remuneration must not exceed \$850,000 per annum.

#### *1. Base Pay and Non-Monetary Benefits*

- 1 July to 31 December
	- 1 January to 30 June

- Business performance KPIs based on achievement of revenue targets for the financial year and achievement of EBIDTA targets outlined for the financial period. At the end of the assessment period the Board will assess the Group's performance against the established targets.
- Personal performance KPIs based on achievement of an approved personal performance agreement with personal business goals aligned to departmental and company strategies. Personal performance goals are set and assessed for each assessment period.
- Commencement and retention of employment for the entirety of the assessment period.

#### *3. Share-Based Payments (Long-Term Incentives)*

*Overview:* Subject to the ASX listing rules and under the terms of the long-term incentives plan (LTIP), the Board may grant options and/or performance rights (options with a nil exercise price) to eligible participants (awards). Each award granted represents a right to receive one share once the award vests and is exercised by the relevant participant

*Performance Period:* Options or performance rights awarded under the LTIP will be subject to vesting periods and conditions as stipulated in the terms of the plan as determined by the Board

*Performance Criteria:* The Board will determine the terms and conditions of awards under the LTIP including but not limited to the following: ▪ which individuals will be invited to participate; ▪ the number of awards to be granted to each participant; ▪ the fee payable, if any, by participants; ▪ the terms on which the awards will vest and become exercisable; ▪ the exercise price, if any, of each award; ▪ the period during which a vested award can be exercised; and ▪ any forfeiture conditions or disposal restrictions applying to the awards and shares received upon exercise of awards. *Discretion:* The Board has sole and absolute discretion to determine the terms and conditions of awards which are granted under the LTIP During the year ending 30 June 2022, the Group engaged a third-party advisor to benchmark select executive remuneration against comparative companies and market peers. The company did not receive any remuneration recommendations as part of this work, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001. A review of the LTIP is currently in progress to ensure the Group's LTI policy is aligned to shareholder interests, whilst acting as an effective tool in the attraction, retention and motivation of executives and other KMP. The Group intends to establish the new LTIP framework during H1 FY2023, providing improved structure and transparency on the timing and quantum of equity instrument grants, as well as the vesting conditions that align with shareholder values. *Group performance and link to remuneration* Remuneration for certain individuals is directly linked to the performance of the Group. A cash bonus and incentive payments are dependent on KPIs being met. Refer to the section 'Additional information' below for details of the earnings and total shareholders return for the last five years. The Committee is of the opinion that the continued improved results can be attributed in part to the adoption of performancebased compensation and is satisfied that this improvement will continue to increase shareholder wealth if maintained over the coming years. *Voting and comments made at the company's 2021 Annual General Meeting ('AGM')* At the 2021 AGM, 78.11% of the votes received supported the adoption of the remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 2021. The company did not receive any specific feedback at the AGM regarding its remuneration practices. *Key Management Personnel* The KMP of the Group consisted of the following persons: Name Position Changes during FY22 *Non-Executive Directors* Nicholas Chan Non-Executive Chairman Simon Dulhunty Non-Executive Director Rebekah Giles Non-Executive Director Appointed 8 February 2022 Anna Massion Non-Executive Director Appointed 3 March 2022 Matt Davey Non-Executive Director Resigned 21 April 2022 *Executive KMP* Todd Buckingham Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Jake Henson Chief Operating Officer Anthony Pullin For personal use only Chief Financial Officer

* A cash short term incentive (STI) was paid to staff in January 2021. The Board agreed several strategic operational targets by which the execution of these targets would give rise to a short-term incentive, payable at the Board's discretion. All Board set operational targets were met, and 100% of the agreed incentive was paid.

Details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor for non-audit services provided during the financial year by the auditor are outlined in note 23 to the financial statements.

{26}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)

The Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the financial year, by the auditor (or by another person or firm on the auditor's behalf), is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001.

The Directors are of the opinion that the services as disclosed in note 23 to the financial statements do not compromise the external auditor's independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:

- all non-audit services have been reviewed and approved to ensure that they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and
▪ none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) issued by the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board, including reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision-making capacity for the Group, acting as advocate for the Group or jointly sharing economic risks and rewards.

#### **Officers of the Group who are Former Partners of PKF(NS) Audit & Assurance Limited Partnership**

There are no officers of the Group who are former partners of PKF(NS) Audit & Assurance Limited Partnership.

#### **Auditor's Independence Declaration**

A copy of the auditor's independence declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out immediately after this directors' report.

This report is made in accordance with a resolution of directors, pursuant to section 298(2)(a) of the Corporations Act 2001.

It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.

#### **Parent entity information**

In accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the group only. Supplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 28.

#### **Principles of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of BetMakers Technology Group Ltd as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.

Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

### **Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the group are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration transferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent.

Where the group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The group recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or reduction in profit or loss.

### **Foreign currency translation**

The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is BetMakers Technology Group Ltd's functional and presentation currency.

#### *Foreign currency transactions*

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the company's functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.

### *Foreign operations*

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.

The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.

## **Revenue recognition**

#### *Revenue from contracts with customers*

Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the group is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the group: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised. For personal use only

Variable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are recognised as a refund liability.

#### *Global Racing Network*

Global Racing Network ('GRN') revenue is recognised in the profit or loss once the service has been rendered. The provision of GRN services includes working with racing bodies and rights holders to produce and distribute racing content. Revenue is derived as a percentage of turnover derived from the racing content. Revenue is therefore recognised in-line with the delivery of services, based on the contracted fee or reported turnover.

{34}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_34_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### **Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

#### *Global Betting Services*

Global Betting Services ('GBS') revenue is recognised in the profit or loss once the service has been rendered. The provision of GBS includes the provision of racing data to customers, the provision of analytical tools to assist in consuming racing data and wagering products to bookmakers such as platforms and managed trading services. Revenue is derived as a fixed fee or a percentage of turnover / profit derived from the services provided. Revenue is therefore recognised in-line with the delivery of services, based on the contracted fee or reported turnover / profit.

#### *Global Tote*

Global tote revenue is recognised in the profit or loss once the service has been rendered. The provision of Global tote services includes the provision of tote software and integrations to facilitate tote liquidity and resulting. Revenue is derived as a fixed fee or a percentage of turnover derived from the services provided. Revenue is therefore recognised in-line with the delivery of services, based on the contracted fee or reported turnover.

#### *Interest*

Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

#### **Current and non-current classification**

Assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.

An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

#### **Lease make good provision**

A provision has been made for the present value of anticipated costs for future restoration of leased premises. The provision includes future cost estimates associated with closure of the premises. The calculation of this provision requires assumptions such as application of closure dates and cost estimates. The provision recognised for each site is periodically reviewed and updated based on the facts and circumstances available at the time. Changes to the estimated future costs for sites are recognised in the statement of financial position by adjusting the asset and the provision. Reductions in the provision that exceed the carrying amount of the asset will be recognised in profit or loss. For personal use only

#### **Goods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes**

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of financial position.

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows.

Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.

{35}------------------------------------------------

#### **Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)**

#### **Rounding of amounts**

The company is of a kind referred to in Corporations Instrument 2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, relating to 'rounding-off'. Amounts in this report have been rounded off in accordance with that Corporations Instrument to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar.

#### **New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted**

Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2022. The group's assessment of the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations, most relevant to the group, are set out below.

Amending accounting standards issued are not considered to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the group as their amendments provide either clarification of existing accounting treatment or editorial amendments.

#### *AASB 2020-1 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current*

AASB 2020-1 was issued in March 2020 and is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, as extended by AASB 2020-6. Early adoption is permitted. This standard amends AASB 101 'Presentation of Financial Statements' to clarify requirements for the presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position as current or noncurrent. The amendments clarify that a liability is classified as non-current if an entity has the right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. If the deferral right is conditional, the right only exists if, at the end of the reporting period, those conditions have been complied with. Classification of a liability as non-current is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date or even if the entity settles the liability prior to issue of the financial statements. The meaning of settlement of a liability is also clarified. For personal use only

#### **Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are discussed below.

#### *COVID-19*

Judgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that COVID-19 has had, or may have, on the group based on known information. This consideration extends to the nature of the products and services offered, customers, supply chain, staffing and geographic regions in which the group operates. Other than as addressed in specific notes, there does not currently appear to be either any significant impact upon the financial statements or any significant uncertainties with respect to events or conditions which may impact the group unfavourably as at the reporting date or subsequently as a result of COVID-19.

#### *Share-based payment transactions*

The group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees and third parties by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using either the Binomial or Black-Scholes model, depending on the equity-settled transaction, and takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period but may impact profit or loss and equity.

#### *Allowance for expected credit losses*

The allowance for expected credit losses assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based on the lifetime expected credit loss, grouped based on days overdue, and makes assumptions to allocate an overall expected credit loss rate for each group. These assumptions include recent sales experience, historical collection rates, the impact of COVID-19 and forward-looking information that is available. The allowance for expected credit losses, as disclosed in note 9, is calculated based on the information available at the time of preparation. The actual credit losses in future years may be higher or lower.

{36}------------------------------------------------

#### **Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)**

### *Goodwill*

The group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the stated accounting policy. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of assumptions, including estimated discount rates based on the current cost of capital and growth rates of the estimated future cash flows.

#### *Income tax*

The group is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on the group's current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the carrying amounts, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Refer to note 7 for further details.

#### *Recovery of deferred tax assets*

Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses and deductible temporary differences only if the group considers it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and that the company continues to meet the Same Business Test and Similar Business Test rules as applicable. With changes to corporate tax rates in Australia in future financial years, there is judgement regarding the tax rate expected to apply when assets are recovered.

During the year, the group incurred a net loss after tax of \$89,234,000 (2021: \$17,459,000) and net operating cash outflows of \$18,224,000 (2021: outflows of \$2,023,000). The company has prepared cash flow forecasts as at 30 June 2022 to determine the recoverability of the group's intangibles and deferred tax assets.

The key assumptions underlying these forecasts are as follows:

- Launch of fixed odds wagering in the USA;
- Continuation of existing domestic operations and expansion of associated revenues (including the NTD platform); and
- The successful expansion of the global racing network.

#### *Deferred consideration*

The deferred consideration liability is the difference between the total purchase consideration, usually on an acquisition of a business combination or assets, and the amounts paid or settled up to the reporting date, discounted to net present value. The group applies provisional accounting for any business combination. Any reassessment of the liability during the earlier of the finalisation of the provisional accounting or 12 months from acquisition-date is adjusted for retrospectively as part of the provisional accounting rules in accordance with AASB 3 'Business Combinations'. Thereafter, at each reporting date, the deferred consideration liability is reassessed against revised estimates and any increase or decrease in the net present value of the liability will result in a corresponding gain or loss to profit or loss. The increase in the liability resulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. For personal use only

#### *Performance payments*

Management makes estimates and judgements as part of calculating the performance payment liabilities accounted for at reporting date. Any reassessment of the liability during the earlier of the finalisation of the provisional accounting or 12 months from acquisition-date is adjusted for retrospectively as part of the provisional accounting rules in accordance with AASB 3 'Business Combinations'. Thereafter, at each reporting date, the performance payment liability is reassessed against revised estimates and any increase or decrease in the net present value of the liability will result in a corresponding gain or loss to profit or loss. Refer to note 28 for performance payment liabilities accounted for at reporting date.

#### *Retirement benefit obligation*

The group operates a defined benefits pension scheme. A liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans is recognised in the statement of financial position, and is measured at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of the superannuation fund's assets at that date and any unrecognised past service cost. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments which arise from membership of the fund to the reporting date, calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.

{37}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_37_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### **Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)**

The independent actuaries utilise a number of data points to determine the present value of the schemes liability at each reporting date. Any change in the value of the net liability is accounted for in the statement of profit or loss during the period in which it arises. Refer to note 18.

### **Note 4. Operating segments**

#### *Identification of reportable operating segments*

The group operates in four segments being Global Racing Network, Global Betting Services, Global Tote and corporate. This is based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (who are identified as the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM')) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. There is no aggregation of operating segments.

The information reported to the CODM is on at least a monthly basis. The financial information presented in these financial statements are the same as that presented to the CODM.

*Types of products and services*

The principal products and services of each of these operating segments are as follows:

| Global Racing Network   | The group assists racing bodies and rights holders in producing and distributing race<br>content. This includes services such as barrier technology, official price calculation, vision<br>and pricing distribution.                                                                        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global Betting Services | The group provides customers with a variety of racing software, data and analytical tools.<br>This includes basic race data such as pricing, runners, and form, analytical tools to<br>consume and leverage the data, and wagering tools such as platforms and managed<br>trading services. |
| Global Tote             | This includes the provision of tote software and integrations to facilitate tote liquidity and<br>resulting.                                                                                                                                                                                |

There are no intersegment transactions.

#### *Major customers*

There were no customers that represented more than 10% of revenue at the year ended 30 June 2022 (for the year ended 30 June 2021, the largest customer represented 24% of revenue).

#### *Accounting policy for income tax*

#### *Accounting policy for deferred tax*

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed each reporting date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously.

#### **Note 7. Income tax (continued)**

#### *Tax consolidated group*

BetMakers Technology Group Ltd (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group ('tax group') under the tax consolidation regime. Each entity in the tax group continues to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax group has applied the 'group allocation' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to group members. In addition to its own tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the tax arising from unused tax losses and tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax group.

#### **Note 9. Trade and other receivables (continued)**

Employee Share Loans were extended to select employees in March 2015 for the purpose of purchasing shares in OM Group Holdings (the parent entity prior to IPO). The loans are repayable upon receipt of dividends or sale of shares. There was no interest charged on these loans during the period. The loans have been fully recognised as not receivables at 30 June 2022. The loans have not been 'forgiven' and the company is exploring settlement options.

#### *Allowance for expected credit losses*

| The ageing of the receivables and allowance for expected credit losses provided for above are as follows:<br>o                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                              |                                              |                                      |                                      |                                                              |                                                                                                                         |

#### **Note 10. Property, plant and equipment (continued)**

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment over their expected useful lives as follows:

| Leasehold improvements | under the lease term |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Plant and equipment    | 5 years              |
| Computer equipment     | 2.5 years            |
| Furniture and fittings | 5 years              |

| l<br>Accounting policy for right-of-use assets<br>n<br>A right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which<br>comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the<br>commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the<br>o<br>cost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and<br>restoring the site or asset. |                   |                   |  |  |
| Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful<br>e<br>life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the group expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the<br>lease term, the asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted<br>for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.<br>s                                                                                                                                                        |                   |                   |  |  |
| The group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms<br>u<br>of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as<br>incurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                   |                   |  |  |

The discount rate of 12.5% pre-tax reflects management's conservative estimate of the time value of money and the group's weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risk free rate and the volatility of the share price relative to market movements.

The Board believes the projected revenue growth rate is prudent and justified, based on the combination of current growth rates and planned product introductions.

#### **Note 12. Intangibles (continued)**

#### *Sensitivity analysis*

As disclosed in note 3, the directors have made judgements and estimates about the future in respect of impairment testing of goodwill. Should these judgements and estimates not occur as approximated, the resulting goodwill carrying amount may decrease. The sensitivities of the carrying value of goodwill to such judgements and estimates are as follows:

- Expected revenues from the three operating segments would need to decrease in excess of 15% in the cash flow modelling before goodwill and the intangible assets noted above would become impaired, with all other assumptions remaining constant.

#### *Accounting policy for trade and other payables*

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the group prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature they are measured at amortised cost and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.

| e<br>Accounting policy for lease liabilities<br>A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present<br>value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or,<br>s<br>if that rate cannot be readily determined, the group's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments<br>less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be<br>u<br>paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably<br>certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties. |              |        |
| Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured<br>l<br>if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual<br>a<br>guarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an<br>adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset<br>is fully written down.<br>n                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |              |        |

#### *Amounts not expected to be settled within the next 12 months*

The current provision for employee benefits includes all unconditional entitlements where employees have completed the required period of service and also those where employees are entitled to pro-rata payments in certain circumstances. The entire amount is presented as current, since the group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement. However, based on past experience, the group does not expect all employees to take the full amount of accrued leave or require payment within the next 12 months.

| e<br>Accounting policy for provisions<br>Provisions are recognised when the group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, it is<br>probable the group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the<br>s<br>obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present<br>obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the time value of<br>u<br>money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate specific to the liability. The increase in the provision<br>resulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. |                                     |                              |

#### **Note 18. Retirement benefit obligations (continued)**

Under the adopted mortality tables, if the future life expectancy were to be decreased by one year the liabilities would decrease by US\$11,851 (2021: US\$11,645).

If the discount rate were to be increased to 5.25% (2021: 3.25%) the liabilities would decrease by US\$195,988 (2021: US\$283,787).

The qualified actuaries that valued the scheme are The Prudential Insurance Company.

#### *Risk exposure*

Through the defined benefits plan, the group is exposed to a number of risks. The significant risks are detailed below:

### Asset volatility

The plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to the Pru Above Mean Curve; If plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The US pension scheme assets are invested in a guaranteed return fund. The plan purchases annuities under the GR-03607 contract at retirement. Under this contract, annuities are purchased based on a table of fixed factors that are not subject to the rate environment at retirement, which removes volatility and risk on asset values.

#### Changes in the Pru Above Mean Curve

A decrease in the Above Mean Curve will increase plan liabilities.

#### Life Expectancy

The plan's obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities.

### *Accounting policy for retirement benefit obligations*

The group operates various pension schemes.

The group has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section within its plan. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The group pays contributions to privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.

The defined benefit section provides defined lump sum benefits based on years of service and final average salary.

A liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans is recognised in the statement of financial position, and is measured at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of the superannuation fund's assets at that date and any unrecognised past service cost. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments which arise from membership of the fund to the reporting date, calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. For personal use only

Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised, in the period in which they occur, in other comprehensive income.

Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the changes to the superannuation fund are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time ('the vesting period'). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight -line basis over the vesting period.

#### *Market risk*

#### *Foreign currency risk*

| y<br>The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily<br>with respect to the Euro, Pound Sterling and the US dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions undertaken in<br>foreign currencies, the translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities and from the translations into Australian<br>l<br>dollars of the results and net assets of overseas operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |           |            |             |            |

#### *Price risk*

### *Interest rate risk*

#### *Credit risk*

The group has adopted a lifetime expected loss allowance in estimating expected credit losses to trade receivables through the use of a provisions matrix using fixed rates of credit loss provisioning. These provisions are considered representative across all customers of the group based on recent sales experience, historical collection rates and forward-looking information that is available.

#### **Note 22. Financial instruments (continued)**

#### *Liquidity risk*

Vigilant liquidity risk management requires the group to maintain sufficient liquid assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents) and available borrowing facilities to be able to pay debts as and when they become due and payable. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, raising capital to fund growth and by monitoring actual and forecast cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

#### **Note 23. Fair value measurement**

#### *Fair value hierarchy*

The following tables detail the group's assets and liabilities, measured or disclosed at fair value, using a three level hierarchy, based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the entire fair value measurement, being:

Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date

| Accounting policy for fair value measurement<br>s<br>When an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair<br>value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction<br>u<br>between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal<br>market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.<br>Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming<br>l<br>they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and<br>a<br>best use. Valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to<br>measure fair value, are used, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable<br>inputs. |                                       |                                     |                              |
| n<br>Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified into three levels, using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the<br>significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.

#### <span id="page-66-0"></span>*Sportech Holdco 1 Limited ('Sportech')*

The goodwill of \$16,092,000 represents the expected synergies from combining the assets with the BetMakers Group, and expanding the racing software, data and tote offering globally. As part of the transaction consideration, the group and Sportech PLC are to review the completion balance sheet and make requisite payments for the net debt and net working capital position. As at 30 June 2022, the group paid the remaining net payment to Sportech PLC of \$5,741,000 (refer to note 13 and note 23).

The values identified in relation to the acquisition of Sportech have now been finalised. This has resulted in an increase in software by \$6,859,000 and an increase in customer contracts by \$10,000,000. As a result, goodwill on acquisition decreased by \$16,092,000. There was no impact on the comparative period statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or the opening retained earnings. The fair value table below and the comparative year statement of financial position as at 30 June 2021 have been adjusted accordingly.

#### *Accounting policy for business combinations*

The consideration transferred is the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the non-controlling interest in the acquiree is measured at either fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred to profit or loss.

On the acquisition of a business, the group assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic conditions, the group's operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions in existence at the acquisition-date.

#### **Note 29. Business combinations (continued)**

Where the business combination is achieved in stages, the group remeasures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at the acquisition-date fair value and the difference between the fair value and the previous carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.

#### **Note 30. Interests in subsidiaries**

| y<br>Contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at the acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent<br>changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss.<br>l<br>Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                               |                    |                    |  |

| n<br>The difference between the acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest<br>in the acquiree and the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any pre-existing investment in the<br>o<br>acquiree is recognised as goodwill. If the consideration transferred and the pre-existing fair value is less than the fair value<br>of the identifiable net assets acquired, being a bargain purchase to the acquirer, the difference is recognised as a gain directly<br>in profit or loss by the acquirer on the acquisition-date, but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement<br>of the net assets acquired, the non-controlling interest in the acquiree, if any, the consideration transferred and the acquirer's<br>e<br>previously held equity interest in the acquirer. |                               |                    |                    |  |
| Business combinations are initially accounted for on a provisional basis. The acquirer retrospectively adjusts the provisional<br>s<br>amounts recognised and also recognises additional assets or liabilities during the measurement period, based on new<br>information obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition-date. The measurement period ends<br>u<br>on either the earlier of (i) 12 months from the date of the acquisition or (ii) when the acquirer receives all the information<br>possible to determine fair value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                               |                    |                    |  |

#### *Accounting policy for share-based payments*

The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods.

{74}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_74_Picture_1.jpeg)

Market conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair value. Therefore any awards subject to market conditions are considered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market condition has been met, provided all other conditions are satisfied.

If equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification.

If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the group or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the group or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited.

If equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.

## **Note 35. Events after the reporting period**

The group announced the intention to undertake an on-market share buy-back on 24 June 2022. The buy-back commenced on 12 July 2022. At the time of this report, the company had purchased 1,572,022 ordinary shares at an average price of \$0.385 per share.

On 12 August 2022, the company announced that it had entered into a deed of variation to amend the contract with NTD Pty Limited to provide technology and services to the new NTD wagering venture. In addition, NTD has agreed to purchase certain assets pertaining to the wagering business owned and operated by O'Shea Bookmaking Pty Ltd (trading as "TexBet") with BetMakers' support. Under the amended terms, the company will increase the Annual Fee payable by NTD to OM Apps by \$2 million per annum, BetMakers will contribute a total of \$2.5 million over two tranches towards the purchase of TexBet by NTD.

No other matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 2022 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the group's operations, the results of those operations, or the group's state of affairs in future financial years.

### Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current period.

## Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

- 1. Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets
As disclosed in Note 12, the Group has goodwill and other intangible assets of \$65.8m as at 30 June 2022 (2021: \$67.9m).

The Group is required to determine whether there is any indication that the intangible assets are impaired under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets.

The Group uses the "value-in-use" methodology in determining the recoverable amount which measures the present value of future cashflows expected to be derived from these assets.

The evaluation of the recoverable amount requires the Group to exercise significant judgment, which include:

- 5-year cash flow forecast;
- Growth rates;
- Terminal growth factor; and
- Discount rate.

The outcome of the impairment assessment could vary if different assumptions were applied. As a result, the evaluation of the recoverable amount of goodwill and other intangible assets is a Key Audit Matter.

Why significant How our audit addressed the key audit matter

As part of our procedures we assessed the Group's determination of Cash Generating Units (CGUs). Our procedures included but were not limited to the following:

- assessing reasonableness of the FY23 budget approved by the Board by comparing the budget to FY22 actuals and other financial information;
- reviewing key assumptions for long term growth in the forecast cash flows by comparing them to historical results and industry forecasts;
- assessing using corporate finance specialists the discount rate applied by comparing the Weighted Average Cost of Capital to industry benchmarks;
- reviewing on a sample basis, the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models;
- assessing management's sensitivity analysis in relation to key assumptions including discount rate, growth rate and terminal value;
- assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures including those relating to sensitivities in the assumptions used, included in Note 12; and
- assessing the expected utilisation of the software and intellectual property acquired and their useful lives for amortisation purposes.

## Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

#### 2. Business Combinations and Acquisition Accounting

As disclosed in Note 29 of the financial report, the Group completed a material business acquisition on 17 June 2021, electing to utilise the provisional accounting measurement period in accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations as at 31 June 2021.

As at 30 June 2022, the Group have finalised the values identified in relation to the acquisition that has resulted in a reallocation of goodwill and intangible balances.

These acquisitions represent a significant expansion of existing operations as well as the acquisition giving rise to a significant goodwill balance.

Based on the above, we have considered the accounting for business combinations and acquisition accounting to be a Key Audit Matter.

#### Why significant How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our procedures included, but were not limited to, the following:

- assessing the reasonableness and accuracy of the allocation of the fair value of assets and liabilities, consideration paid and the allocation of goodwill and intangibles;
- performing an assessment over the acquisition accounting performed in accordance with AASB 3 Business Combinations;
- assessing the third-party Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) report for accuracy and reasonableness of key assumptions;
- reviewing and testing the key terms and conditions of the share sale deeds; and,
- assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 29 in respect of the business combinations.

#### 3. Performance Rights and Employee Share Based Payment Scheme

As disclosed in Note 20 and 34, the Group had a Share-Based payment expense of \$71m (2021: \$12.3m) and Exercised options of \$17.6m (2021: \$0.98m) as at 30 June 2022.

The share options have been classified as an equity settled share based payment transaction in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards.

Based on the above, we have considered the accounting for the Share-Based payments to be a Key Audit Matter.

### Why significant How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our procedures included, but were not limited to, the following:

- assessing the vesting conditions and considering whether these attributes were appropriately included in the share option valuation model;
- reviewing the input data of the independent valuations;
- comparing the grant date to publicly available supporting data;
- performing re-calculations of the share based payment expense;
- assessing vesting conditions to confirm performance measures had been met; and
- assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures in Note 20 and 34.

## Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

- 4. Revenue from contracts with customers
For the year ended 30 June 2022, revenue amounted to \$91.6m (2021: \$19.5m) as disclosed in Note 5 of the Financial Report.

The Group's accounting policy in respect of revenue is outlined in Note 1.

Accordingly, given the nature of the judgement in the accounting for revenue from contracts from customers, we have determined this to be a key audit matter.

#### Why significant How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our work included, but was not limited to, the following procedures:

- Obtaining an understanding of, and testing selected key controls for their operating effectiveness;
- Reviewing significant contracts to understand their terms and conditions and their impact on revenue recognition;
- Using data analytics techniques on revenue schedules to provide enhanced insights and identify potential exceptions and anomalies for further investigation;
- Testing a sample of revenue items from across all revenue streams to ensure accuracy and completeness of recognition in accordance with accounting standards;
- Testing revenue cut-off testing to ensure the recognition of revenue in the appropriate periods; and
- Assessing the appropriateness of the related disclosures in Notes 5 and 1.

## Other Information

Other information is financial and non-financial information in the annual report of the Group which is provided in addition to the Financial Report and the Auditor's Report. The directors are responsible for Other Information in the annual report.

The Other Information we obtained prior to the date of this Auditor's Report was the Director's report. The remaining Other Information is expected to be made available to us after the date of the Auditor's Report.

Our opinion on the Financial Report does not cover the Other Information and, accordingly, the auditor does not and will not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report.

In connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the Other Information. In doing so, we consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

{80}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_80_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Other Information (cont'd)

We are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information in the Financial Report and based on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained prior the date of this Auditor's Report we have nothing to report.

## Directors' Responsibilities for the Financial Report

The Directors of the Group are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the Directors are responsible for assessing the consolidated entity's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the consolidated entity or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue and auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individual or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the consolidated entity's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and other related disclosures made by the Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the consolidated entity's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the consolidated entity to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

{81}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_81_Picture_0.jpeg)

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report (cont'd)

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the consolidated entity to express an opinion on the Group financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Report on the Remuneration Report

## Opinion

We have audited the Remuneration Report included in the directors' report for the year ended 30 June 2022.

In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Betmakers Technology Group Limited for the year ended 30 June 2022, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.

## Responsibilities

The directors of the Group are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.
