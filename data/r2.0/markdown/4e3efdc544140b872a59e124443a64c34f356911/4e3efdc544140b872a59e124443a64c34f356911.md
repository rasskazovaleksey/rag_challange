Guaranty Bancshares realized strong financial results during the year. Total loans for the Company grew \$470.1 million during the year, to a record high of \$2.4 billion. Total deposits ended the year with growth of \$10.3 million and, likewise, a new record total of \$2.7 billion. One of our primary goals for 2022 was to exceed the previous year's net income, which was a tall order given that 2021 included over \$7.8 million in PPP-related extraordinary income and a reverse provision to our loan loss reserves of \$1.7 million. I'm pleased to say we achieved this goal.

The Company generated net income of \$40.4 million, compared to \$39.8 million in the prior year, a \$641,000 or a 1.6% increase. We accomplished this result even after taking a \$3.4 million provision for potential future loan losses during the last quarter of the year. We felt this provision, while no credit losses were imminent or identified, was prudent given the forecast of a possible recession in 2023.

It was a tough year for the stock market in 2022, and our stock price was no exception. While we certainly added significant intrinsic value to our Company, our total return for the year was disappointing at -5.5%, including the \$0.88 per share dividend. This compares to a total return on the NASDAQ of -32.5%, S&P 500 of -18.1%, and our benchmark S&P Small Cap Banks Index of -11.8%. While it's nice to be down less than other indexes, it doesn't change the economics for our shareholders. However, we remain poised to repurchase shares at

**The past year was eventful, to say the least, and many positive developments have continued to drive our Company's growth and progress. However, as we entered the first quarter of 2023, we witnessed two bank failures, concerns about the health of the overall banking system and continued discussions of a recession. In the midst of these economic uncertainties and challenges, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders while fairly and consistently serving our customers and clients, as we have for 110 years. I will comment on the banking industry issues further into my letter, provide data that highlights how Guaranty is different from the banks that have had trouble and will explain the various strengths of our Company. But before that, I will start by reporting on the financial results and achievements of 2022.**

**DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS,**

discounted prices when opportunities are favorable for shareholders. In 2022, we repurchased 2% of our common shares outstanding. These transactions will continue to be very accretive to our remaining shareholders in the coming years, and we maintain excess capital to repeat this strategy when the opportunity is right. We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.

## IN THE MIDST OF THESE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES, WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO DELIVERING VALUE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS WHILE FAIRLY AND CONSISTENTLY SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS, AS WE HAVE FOR 110 YEARS.

Another weakness exposed during the recent bank failures is the risk of an overly concentrated deposit base, which can mirror the risk of an overly concentrated loan portfolio. One of the troubled banks had nearly 90% of their deposits in uninsured accounts. In comparison, Guaranty has uninsured deposits of 29%. We also have a very granular deposit base with 83,753 total deposit accounts carrying an average balance of \$31,914. This granularity is a significant strength in determining the stability of a bank's deposit base. Likewise, our loan portfolio, by design, is very granular. The average loan balance of the entire loan portfolio is \$204,000. As of year-end, we had only 12 loans with committed balances over \$10 million, only two of which were over \$20 million, and and no loans over our internally set loan limit of \$30 million, which is significantly below our legal loan limit of \$54 million. This intentional granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio is a strength that adds significant resilience during an economic downturn. Much like holding additional liquidity, maintaining a conservative position in our loan portfolio often comes at the expense of lower annual earnings than a more concentrated and less granular portfolio would generate. However, we are not willing to take on that riskier profile for whatever marginal improvements in earnings it would generate.

We will continue to manage our balance sheet with an eye toward successfully managing risks, while striving to achieve a fair return for our shareholders. As I've said before, in a highly leveraged and cyclical business like banking, there's no way to achieve consistency in financial performance while maintaining a constant "risk-on" mentality. A risk-on philosophy will maximize returns during periods of economic expansion, but you often give back some of those returns when the economy contracts. In extreme cases, as we have seen this year, you can end up giving back all of your returns. Discipline is required to moderate risk when necessary, even when doing so seems overly cautious at the time. Our number one goal as management is to provide fair returns for our shareholders on a consistent basis, and to limit the significant swings in financial performance that are so often witnessed in banks.

Objectives for 2023 are to remain focused on customer needs, with a strong emphasis on managing risks at all levels given the economic environment. In 2023 and beyond, we will continue building our management team to prepare for future growth cycles and management succession. We are in the process of updating our five-year strategic plan, which serves as a roadmap for future goals, projected financial results, and strategic direction. In each five-year strategic plan iteration, we hold

ourselves accountable for obtaining the goals we set, which always appear lofty at the beginning of the plan. However, to date, our team has always found ways to get the job done and successfully execute on each plan!

As I have also stated many times over the years, the key to Guaranty's past and future success lies in our ability to recruit and employ the right people. These individuals promote our core values and culture, while thinking like an owner and staying focused on achieving results. This has been the foundation of our success for more than 50 years. It is not a complicated formula, but it does require daily effort to maintain and execute. As past leaders leave the company, new leaders have to step up into those roles, a process that becomes more complicated as our company grows. Growth adds complexity in banking. Year after year, we strive to maintain our core values and culture while developing leaders at all levels within the Company who can meet this challenge.

During 2022, three individuals retired from our Company that I'd like to highlight. Bill Priefert, who is Chairman and CEO of Priefert Manufacturing in Mount Pleasant, retired from our Company and the Bank's board of directors after 40 years of service. Sara Neal, our Real Estate Department Manager, retired after 41 years with our Bank. Joe

Rose, former President of our Bogata bank location and key member of our credit administration department, retired after 38 years with the Bank. These three individuals represent the best that is Guaranty, and we thank them for their dedication and commitment to helping make Guaranty what it is today. They have the qualities that our Company's new leaders should strive to emulate.

In conclusion, we are very pleased with our 2022 results. While we expect some challenges and headwinds in 2023, with projections of an economic slowdown, we also remain open to potential opportunities. Many economists forecast much slower growth in most industries and further layoffs by companies as they right-size their operations for the slower economic environment. We are very blessed to be in the state of Texas, which continues to enjoy a vibrant economy and should ride through an economic downturn much stronger than other states. For all the reasons listed above, Guaranty remains well-positioned to navigate this uncertain environment successfully. We've built a robust franchise, with a banking footprint that covers the majority of the growth areas in Texas. I remain very optimistic about our future prospects.

Thank you, fellow shareholders, for your continued investment, support, and confidence in Guaranty Bancshares and Guaranty Bank & Trust.

### FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our results of operations, financial condition and financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "should," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result," "expect," "continue," "will," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "projection," "would" and "outlook," or the negative version of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, without limitation, the "Risk Factors" referenced in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, other risks and uncertainties listed from time to time in our reports and documents filed with the SEC, and the following factors: business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our current and future geographic market areas; economic, market, operational, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with our business; natural disasters and adverse weather, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, an outbreak of hostilities, a public health outbreak (such as COVID-19) or other international or domestic calamities, and other matters beyond our control; the composition of our loan portfolio, including deteriorating asset quality and higher loan charge-offs; the laws and regulations applicable to our business; our ability to achieve organic loan and deposit growth and the composition of such growth; increased competition in the financial services industry, nationally, regionally or locally; our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends; our ability to raise additional capital to execute our business plan; acquisitions and integrations of acquired businesses; systems failures or interruptions involving our information technology and telecommunications systems or third-party services; the composition of our management team and our ability to attract and retain key personnel; the fiscal position of the U.S. federal government and the soundness of other financial institutions; and the amount of nonperforming and classified assets we hold. We can give no assurance that any goal or plan or expectation set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Annual Report, and we do not intend, and assume no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances, except as required by applicable law.
