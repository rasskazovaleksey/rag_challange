# **Chairman's Letter**

Peako has made important breakthroughs in its understanding of the geology and potential of our Eastman PGE Project in the East Kimberley region of Western Australia. We are seeking platinum and palladium, the two major Platinum Group Elements (PGEs).

Platinum and palladium are essential for green energy technologies, including current usage in catalytic converters in combustion engines. However, major growth is expected to unfold in applications with green energy technologies and low carbon energy solutions.

Peako's exploration team completed an initial prospectivity review of the Eastman Project and identified ultramafic intrusions that we considered to have the potential to host a large PGE mineralised system. Subsequently, several phases of exploration were completed, aimed at delivering the highest priority prospects as well as improving our understanding of the controls on mineralisation. Importantly, these programs indicated that previous PGE exploration, which had focused on the discontinuous strataform chromite lenses, may not be the optimal exploration target. In parallel with exploration undertaken by the other explorers in the region, we now believe that PGE mineralisation is not limited to the chromite lenses but, importantly, that our targets should also include the stratabound mineralisation within the entire suit of ultramafic units.

This understanding became an important focus for the exploration effort, with the drill program that recently commenced, focusing on the ultramafic units. The results are expected to be released soon.

Geochemical surface sampling has also confirmed the presence of PGEs, with targeted samples taken at Louisa, The Gap and Grand Central prospects returning excellent PGE + Au indications. Further details are included in the Operations Review in this Annual Report.

All this work is a testament to the dedication and focus of our management and exploration team. Led by Executive Director, Rae Clark, and Technical Director, Dr Paul Kitto, the Peako team has significantly increased the understanding of the Eastman PGE Project over the past year. I thank them and the entire Peako team for their hard work.

The coming year looks exciting for the Company. With geology becoming better understood and RC drill results due shortly, we are excited for what we may be able to achieve over the next 12 months.

 On behalf of the Board, I thank our shareholders for their support and financial contribution and to our team, consultants and my fellow directors for their efforts.

E.G. Albers Chairman, Peako Limited 29th September 2022

# **Operations Review**

Peako's focus during FY2022 was its East Kimberley Project with intensive field campaigns conducted across each of the 2021 and 2022 field seasons. Peako's tenure in the region totals 4,029 km2 (Figure 1).

Activities in 2021 were directed towards assessment of the potential for gold and base metal mineralisation and this incorporated surface mapping, an initial phase of aircore geochemistry drilling across target areas defined from surface geochemistry, geology, geophysics and satellite imagery and a follow up phase of RC drilling.

In 2022, Peako focused its exploration efforts on Platinum Group Elements (PGEs). Encouraged by reporting of wide intercepts of PGEs at Pantoro Limited's nearby Halls Creek Project and Future

Metals NL's Panton Project, Peako completed a prospectivity review of the ultramafic intrusions within its Eastman tenement and identified potential for a large PGE mineralised system at the Eastman Intrusive Complex.

Field activities during 2022 included a tectonicstratigraphic architecture study, mapping and rock chip traverses as well as reconnaissance soil sampling. A 4,500m RC drilling program commenced shortly after the end of the financial year, designed to test PGE endowment across the 16.5km strike of the layered Eastman Intrusive Complex.

In 2022, Peako focused its exploration efforts on Platinum Group Elements (PGEs).

# **Eastman PGE Project**

**Peako's Eastman Intrusion is a large relatively underexplored intrusive complex that Peako considers prospective for a major PGE mineral resource.**

The Eastman Intrusion is located within the Central Zone of the Halls Creek Oregon, where an array of mineralised layered mafic-ultramafic intrusive complexes are defined with an established mineral endowment (refer Figure 1).

Known endowment from layered intrusions in the Halls Creek Oregon include:

- • Savannah 15Mt @ 1.40% Ni, 0.62% Cu
- • Copernicus 0.825 Mt @1.24% Ni, 0.81% Cu
- • Panton 5.0 Moz 3E PGE resource

Recent drilling by Pantoro at the Lamboo Intrusion (Figure 1) has also defined wide PGE intercepts, with mineral resource drilling currently in progress.

#### Eastman Intrusion

The Eastman Intrusion is interpreted to extend along strike for approximately 16.5km; divided into an Eastern and Western zone by a granite intrusion. The Eastern Zone extends for ~9.4km with 2.5km under cover, and the Western zone for 7.1km, mostly under cover.

The Eastman Intrusion is a layered mafic to ultramafic intrusive complex comprised predominately of pyroxenite, anorthosite and gabbro. The pyroxenite forms the basal unit with the gabbro and anorthosite overlaying it. The sequence has been variously folded and faulted in places resulting in structural repetition of the sequence. Having multiple layers of the sequence adds considerably to the prospectivity of the intrusive complex.

Widespread anomalous PGE intercepts from sparse, wide-spaced historical drilling over the 16.5km extent of the Eastman Intrusion indicate an extensive PGE mineralised system (refer Figure 2). Historical exploration was focused on the eastern most outcropping ~6.9 km length of the intrusive complex, targeting short discontinuous chromite lenses within the sequence. PGE mineralisation, however, is shown to be stratabound within the ultramafic intrusives.

{8}------------------------------------------------

# **Analogue Intrusions**

The Eastman Intrusion appears geologically similar to the nearby Panton and Lamboo Intrusions. The three intrusive complexes each have the same ultramafic-mafic rock types and similar intrusion sequencing (refer Figure 3).

# **2022 Field Campaign**

Peako's 2022 field campaign focussed predominantly on the PGE exploration

#### Eastman Intrusion Study

A tectono-stratigraphic architectural study completed by Dr David Selley was directed to defining a framework for emplacement of the Eastman Intrusion, and PGE mineralisation contained within it to assist drillhole targeting. Field work involved numerous mapping traverses across the intrusion to evaluate structural controls on emplacement and deformation history. A collection of rock samples at regular intervals for pXRF analysis assisted the definition of magmatic units making up the intrusion as well as Koongie Park Formation host rocks to the intrusion.

The study highlighted associations between carbonate units within the Koongie Park Formation and emplacement of the PGE-bearing ultramafic complex. In addition, the stratigraphic framework identified the occurrence of multiple ultramafic horizons, many having open to isoclinal fold forms associated with thickness variations across the ultramafic intrusions.

#### Rock Chip Analyses

#### **Geochemistry**

Geochemistry results from rock chip samples collected during mapping traverses across three prospects: The Gap, Grand Central and Louisa were returned, with 3E PGE grades up to 2.9g/t. Twelve of the 54 submitted rock chips returned 3E values greater than 0.5 g/t.

Nine of those rock chip samples were subsequently analysed using the nickel sulphide (NiS) fire assay method with total Platinum Group Element (PGE) values for those samples significantly increased.

The NiS fire assay method allows for the analysis of all PGEs (Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium, Iridium, Ruthenium and Osmium) as well as gold. The samples were initially analysed using Aqua Regia and lead collection fire assay methods to provide values for a large suite of elements (53 elements), however this method was unable to analyse for the less abundant PGEs (Rhodium, Iridium, Osmium and Ruthenium).

The best rock-chip NiS fire assay method results were returned from the Louisa Prospect where all five samples returned PGE+Au results greater than 1g/t. Highest assay results from each of the prospects were 3.49g/t PGE+Au at Grand Central, 2.17g/t PGE+Au at Louisa, and 1.17g/t PGE+Au at The Gap (Figure 4).

#### **QEMSCAN and laser petrography study**

A preliminary petrography study on 10 weathered surface samples was completed using QEMSCAN microscopy and LA-ICP-MS laser ablation imaging.

The results defined alteration assemblages and identified positive correlations between Pd and Cu–Ni that could serve as a potential guide for Pd mineralisation in the field. An association between Pt and the weathered rock types were observed, with Pt associated with both chromite and silicate minerals. Chromite samples were also observed to have slightly higher levels of Pt together with occasional PGE nuggets.

Laser results also highlighted the presence of Ruthenium (Ru), Rhodium (Rh), Iridium (Ir), and Osmium (Os), which positively correlated with chromite. In addition, gold (Au) also correlated with the occurrence of chromite.

**QEMSCAN** (Quantitative Evaluation of Materials by Scanning Electron Microscopy) is an integrated automated mineralogy and petrography solution providing quantitative analysis of minerals and rocks. It is configured to measure mineralogical variability based on chemistry at the micrometre-scale.

**LA-ICP-MS** (Laser Ablation – Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometry) is an analytical technique for determining the chemical and isotopic composition of solid samples.

#### Reconnaissance Soil Sampling at Eastman South Area

Reconnaissance soil sampling along 400m spaced lines at 50m intervals was completed at the newly identified Eastman South area, with assay results revealing a number of areas that are anomalous in PGE elements.

The Eastman South area is an interpreted ultramafic sequence with no record of prior exploration. Ultramafic outcrop was identified in the area during fieldwork, confirming the area's potential prospectivity. A total of 1,216 samples were submitted for geochemical analysis of 53 elements including platinum, palladium and gold. Assay results from the soil geochemistry revealed a number of anomalous PGE trends (Figure 5), which aid mapping the location of ultramafic units, particularly in areas of shallow cover. Subsequent work will focus on these trends and will include infill soil sampling, geological mapping and rock chip sampling to identify potential mineralisation for follow-up drill programs.

{11}------------------------------------------------

#### RC drilling

During the reporting period, Peako completed groundwork preparations for a planned 4,500m reverse circulation (RC) drill program, which commenced in July 2022.

The RC drill program was designed to complete first pass wide spaced testing across the Eastman Intrusion's 16.5km strike length to define zones with higher-grade PGE-rich mineralisation within the ultramafics.

As well as incorporating wide-spaced drill fences to test PGE endowment of the complete ultramafic stratigraphy, the drilling program was designed to also include targeted drill sections defined from new and historical data (refer Figure 6).

These drill targets incorporated testing of structural repetition and folding of chromite-rich ultramafic layers within the intrusive sequence, untested soil and rock anomalies as well as VTEM anomalies.

{13}------------------------------------------------

# **2021 Field Campaign – Gold Exploration**

Peako's 2021 field campaign was directed at evaluating a widely identified but often overlooked latent gold potential recorded in historical exploration data.

#### Aircore Geochemistry

An aircore geochemistry drilling program was completed in 2021 that incorporated 473 holes for a total of 3,017 metres across target areas defined from surface geochemistry, geology, geophysics and satellite imagery. Assay results defined two anomalous base metal corridors at Eastman East and Eastman No.2 (refer Figure 7).

#### 'Scout' Drilling

A total of 30 holes for 1,249 metres were completed across six prospects (refer Figure 8), supported by an Exploration Incentive Scheme drilling grant from the Western Australian Government.

While predominantly aimed at testing goldbearing vein systems, all targets were affiliated with polymetallic sulphide halo zones with potential for copper, lead, silver and zinc. Unfortunately, at a number of prospects, highly fractured ground conditions and excessive water hindered the program, resulting in a number of targets not being tested due to rig limitations.

Best drill results were from the Landrigan Prospect where eight reverse circulation (RC) drillholes, totalling 449m were drilled to test the near surface continuation of gold and base metal mineralisation intersected in previous Peako and historic BHP drilling (Figure 9). This zone was attractive as it was located in a fold hinge with coincident surface geochemistry.

#### **Best results at Landrigan included:**

- • 4m @ 6.2 g/t Au from 11m, inc 1m @ 11.6 g/t Au from 12m (PRC0030)
- • 13m @ 40.7 g/t Ag from 11m (PRC0030)
- • 15m @ 2.3% Pb from 9m (PRC0030)
- • 14m @ 0.4% Cu from 11m (PRC0030)
- • 4m @ 1.08 g/t Au from 4m (PRC028
- • 12m @ 0.55% Pb from 0m (PRC028)
- • 7m @ 1.04% Cu from 64m (PRC0028)
- • 4m @ 1.6% Cu from 40m (PRC0029)
- • 16m @ 0.7% Pb from 24m to EOH (PRC0025)

The Landrigan Prospect was originally identified by BHP as a base metal prospect with Peako recognising the prospect's gold potential from results of its 2019 RC drill program. That program intersected Cu-Au mineralisation with results that included 15m @ 1.04% Cu from 184m in PLRC011 and 7m @ 1.1 g/t Au from 133m in PLRC001.

The intercepts from drillhole PRC0030 extend known mineralisation at Landrigan to the northeast by 80m, resulting in a total mineralised strike length of approximately 300m. The mineralisation intersected in hole PRC0030 includes a gold-rich central zone with a polymetallic envelope of Ag-Pb-Cu, with the mineralised trend remaining open to the north-east.

# **Auditor independence**

Section 307C of the *Corporations Act 2001* requires our auditors, Grant Thornton Audit Pty Ltd, to provide the directors of the Company with an Independence Declaration in relation to the audit of the annual report. This Independence Declaration is set out on page 30 and forms part of this directors' report for the year ended 30 June 2022.

#### **Non-audit services**

The Company may decide to employ the auditor on assignments additional to their statutory audit duties where the auditor's expertise and experience with the Company and/or the Group are important. The Company has considered the position and is satisfied that the provision of the non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the *Corporations Act 2001*. The auditor has not provided any non-audit services and as such auditor independence was not compromised.

This report is made in accordance with a resolution of the directors.

**Notes to the Financial Statements** 

#### *For the Year Ended 30 June 2022* **Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies**

#### **(a) Basis of preparation**

The financial report is a general-purpose financial report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the *Corporations Act 2001*, Accounting Standards and Interpretations and other requirements of the law. The financial report has also been prepared on a historical cost basis. The Parent Entity is registered and domiciled in Australia.

The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements for the Group. For the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a for-profit entity.The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, unless otherwise stated.

#### *Going concern*

For the year ended 30 June 2022 the Group incurred a net cash outflow from operating and investing activities of \$2,365,608 (2021: \$2,081,558) and a net loss after tax of \$1,104,118 (2021: \$714,743). As at 30 June 2022, the Group has positive working capital of \$1,423,045 (2021: \$1,154,257).

Directors expect that the group will be able to successfully raise sufficient funding to enable it to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the signing of annual financial report.

The Group raised \$1,403,353 (before costs) in a rights issue completed during September 2022. (Note 17).

This financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. In the event that sufficient funds are not raised to meet all of the Group's commitments, debt and payables, the interest in some or all of the Group's tenements may be affected and all assets and liabilities may not be realised at the amounts disclosed. No adjustments have been made relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern, particularly the write-down of capitalised exploration expenditure should the exploration

permits be ultimately surrendered or cancelled. Having assessed the potential uncertainties relating to the Group's ability to effectively fund exploration activities and operating expenditures, the Directors believe that the Group will continue to operate as a going concern for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis

#### **(b) Adoption of new and revised standards Changes in accounting policies on initial application of Accounting Standards**

The Group has adopted all of the new and revised Accounting Standards issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual reporting periods beginning on 1 July 2021.

#### **(c) Statement of compliance**

The financial report was authorised by the board of directors for issue on 29 September 2022.

The consolidated financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, including the Accounting Interpretations, issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the *Corporations Act 2001*. The financial report of the company complies with International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board

#### **(d) Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries as of 30 June 2022 ("Group"). The Parent controls a subsidiary if it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 30 June.

{36}------------------------------------------------

#### **Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued)**

All transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation, including unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies. Where unrealised losses on intra-group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a group perspective.

Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.

Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.

Non-controlling interests, presented as part of equity, represent the portion of a subsidiary's profit or loss and net assets that is not held by the Group. The Group attributes total comprehensive income or loss of subsidiaries between the owners of the parent and the non-controlling interests based on their respective ownership interests.

#### **(e) Exploration and evaluation**

Exploration and evaluation assets, including the costs of acquiring tenements, are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets on an area of interest basis. Exploration and evaluation assets are only recognised if the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current and either:

- (i) the expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale or partial sale: or
- (ii) activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date, reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.

The tests contained in AASB6.20 are applied to determine whether exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment indicators:

- (i) the exploration and evaluation tenure right has expired or are expected to expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed.
- (ii) substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned.
- (iii) exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area.
- (iv) sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale

#### **(f) Revenue and other income**

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

#### *Interest income*

Interest revenue is recognised on a time proportionate basis that takes into account the effective yield on the financial asset.

#### **(g) Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Temporary bank overdrafts are included in cash at bank and in hand. Permanent bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities in the statement of financial position.

{37}------------------------------------------------

#### **Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued)**

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.

#### **(h) Income tax**

Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance date.

Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:

- when the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or
- when the taxable temporary difference is associated with investments in controlled entities, associates or interests in joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

- when the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or
- when the deductible temporary difference is associated with investments in controlled entities, associates or interests in joint ventures, in which case a deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the financial period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

#### **(i) Other taxes**

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:

- when the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
- receivables and payables, which are stated with the amount of GST included

{38}------------------------------------------------

#### **Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued)**

The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.

Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority, are classified as operating cash flows.

Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.

#### **(j) Motor Vehicles, plant and equipment**

Motor Vehicles Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item. In the event that settlement of all or part of the purchase consideration is deferred, costs are determined by discounting the amounts payable in the future to their present value as at the date of acquisition. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they incurred.

All tangible assets have limited useful lives and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their existing useful lives.

Depreciation is calculated as follows:

| Motor Vehicles, plant | 10% - 33% on a      |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| and equipment         | straight line basis |

The assets' residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial period end.

#### **(j) Impairment of assets**

The carrying amounts of the company's assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there are indicators of impairment. At each reporting date the company assesses whether there is any indication that individual assets are impaired. Where impairment indicators exist, recoverable amount is determined and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss where the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

#### **(k) Trade and other payables**

Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial period that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services.

#### **(l)Provisions**

Where applicable, provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income net of any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.

{39}------------------------------------------------

#### **Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued)**

When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.

#### **(m) Share-based payment transactions**

#### *Equity settled transactions*

Equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees or consultants in exchange for the rendering of services or to incentivise the receiver in their future efforts.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine whether the Consolidated Entity receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment. No account is taken of any other vesting conditions.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods.

Market conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair value. Therefore, any awards subject to market conditions are considered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market condition has been met, provided all other conditions are satisfied.

If equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the sharebased compensation benefit as at the date of modification.

If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the Consolidated Entity or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the Consolidated Entity or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited.

If equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.

#### **(n) Issued capital**

.

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

#### **(o) Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude any costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares.

#### **(p) Foreign currency translation**

Both the functional and presentation currency of Peako Limited and its Australian subsidiaries is Australian dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance date.

{40}------------------------------------------------

#### **Notes to the Financial Statements**  *For the Year Ended 30 June 2022* **NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS** FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

#### **Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued)**

All exchange differences in the consolidated financial report are taken to profit or loss with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss. **(u) Financial Instruments** *Recognition and derecognition*  Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the

Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also recognised in equity. financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. *Classification and initial measurement of financial assets*  Except for those trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component and are measured at the transaction price in accordance with AASB 15, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value adjusted for

The functional currencies of the foreign operations are not nominated in Australian Dollars. As at the balance date the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of Peako Limited at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance date and their income statements are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the year. The exchange differences arising on the translations are taken directly to a separate component of recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. transaction costs (where applicable).

The company makes uses of a simplified approach in accounting for trade and other receivables as well as contract assets and records the loss allowance as lifetime expected credit losses. These are the expected shortfalls in contractual cash flows, considering the potential for default at any point during the life of the financial instrument. In calculating, the company uses its historical experience, external indicators and forward-looking information to calculate the expected credit losses using a provision matrix. All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised in profit or loss are presented within finance costs, finance income or other financial items, except for impairment of trade receivables which is presented within other expenses.

#### **Note 1: Statement of significant accounting policies (continued)**

#### **(u) Financial Instruments**

#### *Recognition and derecognition*

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.

#### *Classification and initial measurement of financial assets*

Except for those trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component and are measured at the transaction price in accordance with AASB 15, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value adjusted for transaction costs (where applicable).

Financial assets, other than those designated and effective as hedging instruments, are classified into the following categories:

- amortised cost
- fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
- fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

In the periods presented the corporation does not have any financial assets categorised as FVOCI. The classification is determined by both:

- the entity's business model for managing the financial asset
- the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset

All income and expenses relating to financial assets that are recognised in profit or loss are presented within finance costs, finance income or other financial items, except for impairment of trade receivables which is presented within other expenses.

#### *Subsequent measurement of financial assets*

Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if the assets meet the following conditions (and are not designated as FVTPL):

- they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold the financial assets and collect its contractual cash flows
- the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding

#### *Impairment of financial assets*

AASB 9's impairment requirements use forward-looking information to recognise expected credit losses – the 'expected credit loss (ECL) model'. Instruments included loans and other debt-type financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI, trade receivables, contract assets recognised and measured under AASB 15 and loan commitments and some financial guarantee contracts (for the issuer) that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The Group considers a range of information when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses, including past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument. In applying this approach, a distinction is made between:

- financial instruments that have not deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition or that have low credit risk ('Stage 1') and
- financial instruments that have deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition and whose credit risk is not low ('Stage 2').

#### **Note 3: Earnings per share**

The loss and weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the calculation of basic and dilutive loss per share is as follows:

| Net loss for the year                           | (1,104,118) | (714,743)   |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|

| Total basic and dilutive loss per share (cents) | (0.36)      | (0.40)      |

Despite having options on issue, basic and dilutive loss per share are the same as there is a loss position and to include options would be anti-dilutive.

### **Note 13: Financial instruments**

#### **Capital risk management**

Prudent capital risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities to ensure continuity of tenure to exploration assets and to be able to conduct the Group's business in an orderly and professional manner. The Board monitors its future capital requirements on a regular basis and will when appropriate consider the need for raising additional equity capital, debt funding or to farmout exploration projects as a means of preserving capital.

#### **Categories of financial instruments**

The Group's principal financial instruments comprise of cash and short-term deposits and short term borrowings. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations. The Group has various

other financial assets and liabilities such as receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.

#### **Financial risk management objectives**

The Group is exposed to market risk (including, interest rate risk and equity price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

{48}------------------------------------------------

# **Note 13: Financial instruments (continued)**

#### **Market risk**

There has been no change to the Group's exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk from the previous period.

#### *Interest rate risk management*

All cash balances attract a floating rate of interest. Excess funds that are not required in the short term are placed on deposit for a period of no more than 6 months. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk and the effective interest rate by maturity periods is set out below.

#### *Interest rate sensitivity analysis*

At 30 June 2022, if interest rates had changed on cash and cash equivalent by 100 basis points (1%) and all other variables were held constant, the Group's after tax profit would have been \$10,574 (2021: \$9,939) lower/higher as a result of higher/lower interest income on cash and cash equivalents.

#### **Credit risk management**

Credit risk relates to the risk that counterparties will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral or other security where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from any defaults.

#### **Foreign currency risk**

The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currency. The functional currency of the group is denominated is Australian dollars.

#### **Liquidity risk management**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Liquidity risk is monitored to ensure sufficient monies are available to meet contractual obligations as and when they fall due.

The following are the contractual maturities of the financial liabilities, including interest payments. Contractual amounts have not been discounted.

#### **INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT** FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2022

#### **Material uncertainty related to going concern**

We draw attention to Note 1(a) in the financial statements, which indicates that the Group incurred a net loss after tax of \$1,104,118 during the year ended 30 June 2022 and a net cash outflow from operating and investing activities of \$2,365,608. As stated in Note 1(a), these events or conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 1(a), indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

#### **Key audit matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

In addition to the matter described in the *Material uncertainty related to going concern* section, we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
