## Resort Operations

#### General

Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments, and repay debt financings.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts, except as otherwise described telated to the impact of COVID-19, typically operate 24 hours a day, every day of the exception of Empire City, which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the timing of entertainment and sports events, the amount and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. Our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amentities may be owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third-party retail and food and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.

As of December 31, 2022, we have three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China, as generally described below. See Note 17 for detailed financial information about our reportable segments.

{9}------------------------------------------------

#### Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations

Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Aria (including Vdara) (upon its acquisition in September 2021), Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan (upon its acquisition in May 2022), MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage (until its disposition in December 2022), Luxor, New York-New York (including The Park), Excalibur, and Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas).

Regional Operations. Regional Operations consists of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica, Mississippi (until its disposition in February 2023); Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, MGM National Harbor in Prince George's County, Maryland; MGM Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York; and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio.

Over half of the net revenue from our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is typically derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming and the majority of the net revenue from our Regional Operations is typically derived from gaming operations. Our long-term strategy continues to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes, which also better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.

Our casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games. In addition, we provide our premium players access to highlimit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.

#### MGM China

We own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming concession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Although visitation during 2020, 2021, and 2022 was significantly reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Cotai.

Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China's revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations, which are conducted under a gaming concession held by MGM Grand Paradise, a subsidiary of MGM China. Gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to six different concessionaires.

#### Corporate and Other

We have additional business activites including LeoVegas, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including BetMGM, and certain other corporate and management operations.

#### Customers and Competition

Our properties operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-rack wagering, card parlors, iGaming and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions - We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our pers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows."

Our primary methods of successful competition include:

- . Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;
- Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention o facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;

future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships.

MGM Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. As members advance through tiers, a host of member benefits are unlocked including priority access, exclusive events and experiences. and the opportunity to redeem MGM Rewards for hotel stays, food and beverage, and other MGM Resorts experiences.

The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.

#### Strategy

We strive to be a leader in the global gaming, entertainment and hospitality industry that delivers extraordinary entertainment across a portfolio of properties in the United States and Macau. The quality of our properties and amenties is evidenced by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association, multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide and numerous certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.

In order to achieve our vision of becoming the world's premier gaming entertainment company, we developed our strategic plan, which centers on five pillars:

- . Strong People and Culture. Recruit, develop and retain the best talent. Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion. Invest in the employee experience.
- . Customer-Centric Model. Leverage a customer-centric model reinforced by a strong brand and deep customer insights to provide unmatched entertainment experiences for our guests and drive top-line growth.
- Operational Excellence. Operating model refinement to diversify business mix, maximize operating efficiencies and expand . margins. Enhancement of digital capabilities to strengthen customer loyalty.
- Disciplined Capital Allocation to Maximize Shareholder Value. Pursuit of targeted, attractive ROI opportunities that align to our strategic vision. Focus on shareholder returns. Fortify balance sheet.
- . Gaming Entertainment. Innovate our gaming entertainment product to drive continued premium positioning and competitive differentiation. Distribute our product offering to serve the broadest total addressable market possible.

The strategic plan was developed with the intent to regularly revisit, measure, and reevaluate for emerging opportunities.

In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investments in our existing properties, strategic growth opportunities, debt repayment and shareholder returns. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns.

We regularly evaluate targeted opportunities that provide an attractive return on investment in domestic and international markets, including the ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting, including our acquisition of Leo Vegas. We also leversge our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities.

We continue to maximize the benefits of our operating model by driving optimization of our Centers of Excellence and enabling best in class operations through adjustments within corporate and property business units. In addition, we have implemented several improvement and cost cutting initiatives comprised of labor, sourcing, and revenue programs that have further improved our operating model and have positioned us as a stronger company.

We have continued to focus on our key growth opportunities of developing an integrated resort in Japan, investing in BetMGM, investing in international digital opportunities through our acquisition of LeoVegas, and exploring a full-scale commercial gaming opportunity in New York. In September 2021, we, together with our venture partner, ORIX, were selected by Osaka as the region's integrated resort partner. This selection marks an important step in our long-term bid to develop one of Japan's first integrated casino

{12}------------------------------------------------

resorts. In April 2022, we submitted an area development and are currently awaiting a decision. As it relates to BetMGM, we believe that BetMGM is positioned as a long-term leader in the U.S. online sports betting and iGaming industries. As part of our commitment to the success of BetMGM, we have integrated our MGM Rewards program with BetMGM and have BetMGM branded on-property sportsbooks and kiosks to drive higher value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omnchannel strategy. Further, we continue to explore full-scale commercial gaming to Empire City in New York. In January 2023. a request for application for three downstate commercial gaming licenses was released, to respond.

#### Technology

We believe technology, digital and advance/analytics capabilities are critical to optimizing customer experience and loyalty, employee productivity and efficiency and revenue growth. We are focused on using these capabilities to achieve specific goals of creating 'only at MGM' differentiation through unique content and experiences, establishing a perennial engagement with our guests for increased loyalty, digital diversification through enhanced e-commerce and seamless integration of the physical integrated resorts business with digital casino and sports betting cross-property experiences and promotions in Las Vegas to provide much better value to the consumer, enhancing our data driven decisioning capabilities in all aspects of our business for faster decision making, and optimizing our operations and experience through digitization. Additionally, this year we have loyalty technology platform that allows customers to earn points through gaming activities, and we have enabled bundling technology capabilities to sell packages customized to a customer segment.

#### Environmental Sustainability

At MGM Resorts, we have had a long-standing commental and social responsibility. For over a decade, we have had a dedicated board committee focused on Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR"). In 2019, we had bolstered governance of these areas by uniting our key pillars of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Philanthropy and Community Engagement and Environmental Sustainability under one Executive Committee-level leader who manages the MGM Resorts Social Impact and Sustainability Center of Excellence, reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and serves as liaison to the CSR and Sustainability board committee. This leader also oversees the Human Resources function, and is thus able to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") considerations more deeply into the core culture of our organization through proactive management of our human and social capital initiatives.

Our most & Sustainability Report built on the robust disclosures of 2021 to illustrate progress across our public social impact and sustainability goals, and we expect to publish a new report in 2023 detailing progress made in 2022.

Our reporting in 2022 contributed to the growing list of disclosures and frameworks to which we align with our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report (published in May 2022).

## Energy & Carbon

The year ended December 31, 2022 was the first full calendar year of operation for our Mega Solar Array ("Mega Array") which. on average, has met or exceeded our productions. We believe that the solar energy produced by the Mega Array will play a key role in meeting our climate goals:

- . 45% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions intensity (pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot; 2007 baseline) by 2025:
- . 50% reduction in absolute Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; 2019 baseline) by 2030; and
- . 100% renewable electricity purchased in U.S. and 80% purchased globally by 2030.

A comprehensive framework lays out four strategic pillars to guide our work: invest in people; build an inclusive culture; grow business and customer engagement and supplier diversity; and enhance marketplace leadership and community relations. As part of our committed to the following four long-range 2025 goals: (1) ensure that all employees have equal access to leadership opportunities, (2) spend at least 10% of our biddable procurement with diverse suppliers, (3) expand our Supplier Diversity Mentorship Program to achieve 150 graduates and (4) train 100% of management employees on social impact and sustainability policies and goals. In connection with each goal, we have established robust key performance indicators, which are tracked and published in our annual Social Impact and Sustainability Report and reviewed internally with management and our CSR &

Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors. In addition, we have detailed internal Human Capital workforce reports, which include demographic and diversity data, and are revewed with the CSR & Sustainability Committee of the Board, executive management, and leadership teams on a regular basis.

Internally, we use multiple channels to facilitate communication and to continuously advance one of our core values, Champion Inclusion. The channels include but are not limited to open forums with executives, employee engagement surveys with detailed action planning, and employee network groups.

Responsibility is driven and led by our Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and is supported by a centralized Diversity and Inclusion team and the Human Resources department.

For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below.

{20}------------------------------------------------

#### Risks Related to Our Substantial Financial Commitments

Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component and guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our abiligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately \$8.8 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis, including \$4.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness of MGM China. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. We do not guarantee MGM China's obligations under its debt agreements and, to the extent MGM China was to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into MGM China is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility.

In addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative on us, including:

- . increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
- . limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
- . limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;
- . making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or
- . placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.

We currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the \$3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of Bellagio BREIT Venture, respectively. The terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collections under the underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation, which amount may not have sufficient oash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future. If we do not hand, we may need to rase capital. including incurring additional indebtedness, in order to satisfy our obligation. There can be no asurance that any financing will be wailable to us, or, if available, will be on terms that are satisfactory to us.

Under the terms of MGM Grand Paradise's concession, MGM Grand Paradise is required to implements in gaming and non-gaming projects, for which the non-gaming commitment is subject to increase if market-wide Macau annual gross gaming revenue reaches a specified level. There can be no assurance, that MGM Grand Paradise will have sufficient cash on hand to find these obligations, including any increased investment amounts to the extent they are triggered in the future, or that it would be able to obtain financing to fund these obligations on satisfactory terms or at all. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to satisfy its investment commitments, its concession contract may be subject to termination by the Macau government. See "—Risks Related to Our Macau government can (i) terminate MGM Grand Paradise's concession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise, (ii) from the eighth year of MGM Grand Paradise's concession by providing MGM Grand Paradise at least one year's prior notice and subject to the payment of reasonable and fair damaty to MGM Grand Paradise, or (ii) refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the concession in 2032."

Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive, we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the maintained, modernized and refurbished. The leases for our operating properties have fixed rental payments (with annual escalators) and also require us to apply a percentage of net reversed at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties. Such in ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in Japan, strategic initiatives, including positioning BetMGM as a leader in online sports betting and iGaming, investments in the growth of our international digital gaming business could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our substantial indebtedness and significant financial comments or make planned expenditures. Our ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness and other significant financial commitments, including the rent payments under our leases, and to fund planned or committed capital 

{21}------------------------------------------------

expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries (including MGM China), and borrow under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness. If regional and national economic conditions deteriorate, including in connection with a recession, revenues from our operations could decline as consumer spending levels decrease and we could fail to generate cash sufficient to financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt and lease instruments. If we fail to generate cash sufficient to financial and other covenants in our debt and lease instruments, we cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional debt on terms favorable to us, or at all.

In addition, we have a significant amount of in 2023, and thereafter. Our ability to fund or timely refinance and replace our indebtedness will depend upon the econditions discussed above. If we are mable to fund or refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis, we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is no assurance that any of these altematives would be available to us, if all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of future debt agreements or leases.

The agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly and therefore could adversely offect our results of operations. Coverning our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:

- pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments; .
- . incur additional debt;
- . incur liens on assets;
- . sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;
- . enter into transactions with affiliates;
- . allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and
- . enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults under agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. Any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures could adversely affect our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial commitments.

In addition, MGM China has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities, all of which contain covenants that restrict the borrower's ability to engage in certain transactions, require MGM China to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain parating and financial restrictions on MGM China and its subsidiaries. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on MGM China's ability to pay dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or sell assets.

We are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our oberations and growth initiatives, service our indebtedness and lint our ability to react to competitive and economic changes. We are required to make annual rent payments of \$1.7 billion, in the agreeate, unch triple-net lease agreements, which leases are also subject to amual escalators as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The leases also require us to spend a certain expenditures at the leased properties. In addition, each of the leases obligates us to comply with certain financial covenants will require us to deposit cash collateral or issue letters of credit of the applicable landlord equal to 6 months or 1 year of rent, as applicable to the circumstances, under the VICI lease, 1 year of rent under Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas lease, the Aria and Vdara lease, and The Cosmopolitan lease, and 2 years of rent under the Bellagio lease. As a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure obligations, our ability to fund our operations, raise capital, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the leases may:

- . make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;
- . increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;

{22}------------------------------------------------

- require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability . of our cash flow to fund working capital expenditures, development projects, pay dividends, repurchase shares and other general corporate purposes;
- . limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
- . restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and
- . cause us to lose our rights with respect to the applicable leased properties if we fail to pay rent or otherwise default on the leases.

Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

#### Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions

We face significant competition with respect to destions generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions and cash flows. The hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming inclustries are highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming operations in other states or countries, as well as the increased availability of online sports betting and iGaming, could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitial new entrants, may also expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenties, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of retail gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere, For instance, local retail gassed to allow retail gaming in Virginia and Nebraska, with active lobbying occurring in additional states. While we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, we also compet against smaller hotel offerings and peer inventory sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments. We expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution, in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that ould impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business.

We have also seen significant expansion across the United States in legalized forms of iGaming and expect additional jurisdictions will likely legalize iGaming in the future. We participate in the domestic iGaming and online sports betting market through our venture, BetMGM, which industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment industries. If BetMGM is unable to sustain or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able necessary to successfully compete in the growing market and, as a result, we may not receive the anticipated benefits from our investment. In addition, the expansion of iGaming, online sports betting, and other compete with our land-based operations by reducing customer visitation and spend at our properties.

In addition, competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the United States and elsewhere are enacted, including the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our casinos. For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or neas in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) may legalize casino gaming (or the future. Furthermore, currently MGM Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessionares open additional facilities, ve would face increased competition. Similarly, as a result of Macau's Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau increasing scrutiyy and restrictions imposed on gaming promoters, we along with certain other casino operators in Macau, suspended our primaty gamoters, which has led to substantial declines in revenues from gamity we expect competition for the mass market segment amongst Macau operators will grow and if we are unable to maintain and further develop our mass market business and replace revenue previously obtained through use of gaming promoters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Most jurisdictions where casino gamitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses. Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise.

*All of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.*\$OORIRXUGRPHVWLFSURSHUWLHVDUHVXEMHFWWRWULSOHQHWOHDVHVWKDWLQDGGLWLRQWRUHQWUHTXLUHXVWR

pay; (1) all facility maintenance requred in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for paying these expenses notwiths that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities. Furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation. Finally, our lease operations at our properties, subject to certain limited exceptions.

Because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diven that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be significantly affected by risks common industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel proces, lower wise, can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between California, where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.

We extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables. We conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games typically are issued more markers than slot players and high-end pically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. Highend gaming is more volatile than other forms of gariances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. Furthermore, the loss of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customers whose of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

While gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.

Furthermore, we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent MGM China gaming customers are from other jurisdictions, MGM China may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM China may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. Moreover, under applicable law, MGM China remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers.

Even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

We may incur impairments to goodwill, intengible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits. We review our goodwill, intangible asses on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of figure cash flows, disruntions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.

Leisure and business travel, especially travel by susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility of infectious diseases. We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of our customers travel by air to our Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air, could adversely affect our financial

{25}------------------------------------------------

condition, results of operations and cash flows. In outbreak of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may severely disrapt domestic and international travel.

Furthermore, although we have been able to purchase coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against physical loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.

Co-investing in properties or businesses, including our investment in BetMGM, decreases our ability to manage risk. In addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from invested, and expect to continue to invest, in properties or businesses as a co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. Therefore, the operation of businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on maters. Furthermore, the occurrence of risks that adversely affect the businesses of our joint ventures or other unconsolidated affiliates could reduce of our investments in such entities, impar their ability to make any potential future distributions to us or require that we make additional capital contributions to them. The shared natures may limit our ability to directly manage these risks.

In addition, investments with other involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a possition to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject the propertes or businesses owned by such entitler, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors could take actions binding on the property without our consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.

For example, we share control of BetMGM with all major operating, investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both members. Disagreements between us and Entain could arise in the future, including with respect to the amount and timing of capital contributions. If we and Entain are unable to support the future finding of BetMGM, then BetMGM may not have the execute on the development or implementation of its strategies, increase its market share, which could result in us not receiving the anticipated benefits from our investment. Finally, if we are awarded a concession to develop an integrated casino resort in Japan, wo would do so in a consortium with ORIX and other local investors. As a result, we could be subject to additional risks related to directly control development activities or the timing of development completion, which may impact our ability to commeted ton our anticipated timeline, or at all, or within the agreed upon specifications.

Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a naterial adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects. Although our business model is primarily asset-light, we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for future construction, development or expansion projects. Any of our future construction, development or expansion proposed integrated resort in Japan and the potential for full-scale commercial gaming at Empire City, will be subject to a number of risks, including:

- . lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;
- . changes to plans and specifications;
- . engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;
- shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor; .
- . pricing inflation, including wage inflation, in key supply markets;
- . delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;
- . changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, residential, real estate development or construction projects;
- . labor disputes or work stoppages;
- . availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;
- . disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
- . personal injuries to workers and other persons;
- . environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;
- . weather interferences or delays;
- . fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;
- . geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
- . other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.

{26}------------------------------------------------

The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future might undertake. In addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or incur payment penalies in connection with could have an adverse effect on our business. financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We also make significant capital expenditures to mantain and upgrade our resorts, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties, including revenue lost while rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service.

Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar . Although we have "all risk" property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters of violence), each policy has certain exclusion, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to over all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, and pollution, may not be overed at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.

In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of be subject to claims by third parties that may be interned. While we carry business interruption insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event. Furthermore, our leases covering the MGM Grand Las Vegas & Mandalay Bay, Bellagio, Aria & Vdara, and The Cosmopolitan all require us to maintain specified insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of insurance coverage required by the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all. then we would need to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease, which could have material adverse effect on our business.

We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles or self-insured retentions, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.

Any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely offect our business. The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to establish and maintain our business operations through the use of trademarks. We file applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite our efforts to proprietary rights, partes may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unentorceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the United States. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.

A significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations. As of December 38.000 of our employees are overed by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining most of our Las Vegas union employees expire in 2023. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our operations, and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and or beneff increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To the extent that our non-union employees seek union representation or elect union representation, we would have exposure to risks association proceedings, labor negotations and/or economic impacts of newly negotiated labor agreements. Furthermore, we may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that

are classified as "endangered," is "seriously endance, Borgati's most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of the UNTE HERE Retirement Fund, which has been listed in "critical status" and is subject to a rehabilitations must adopt measures to improve their finding improvement or relabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retires . In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such additional costs may be significant.

Our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices could harm our operating results. We are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.

We may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properies and other may be unsuccessful. We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses, properties or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue any of these in alliance with third parties. Acquisitions and investments in businesses, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:

- spending cash and incurring debt; .
- . assuming contingent liabilities;
- . unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;
- . unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;
- . retaining key employees; and
- . consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, even if we are able to identify any such opportunities and complete transactions, we camot assure you that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of our acquisitions or that they will be accretive to our results of operations. Our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitions could materially change, including as a result of factors beyond our control, and could delay, decrease or eliminate the expected accetive effect of the aquisitions. In addition, even if we are new assets and businesses, the integration of such asses may result in unanticipated costs, competitive responses, loss of customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention, and the expansions in general, whether through acquisition, development or internal growth, could also cause us to including legal, professional and consulting fees.

In addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other are non-ore, no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

The failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data. We collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, and others for various business purposes, including marketing and proses. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enates, the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent (or conflict) between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enaditional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, California enacted a comprehensive privacy law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the United States. The CCPA was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act with the changes going into effect in 2023. In addition, new privacy requirements will go into effect in 2023 in Colorado. Connecticut. Utah, and Virginia. Outside the European Union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the General Data Protection, which became fully enforceable in May 2018, that provides data subjects with significant privacy-related rights and imposes operational and compliance requirements on organizations with significant penalties for noncompliance. Other jurisdictions including Canada and China have also amended or adopted new privacy laws and/or requirements which often

{28}------------------------------------------------

include similar requirements and obligations. There may be risks and uncertaintes associated with these and regulations including their interpretation and implementation, as well as the potential effect of certain privacy laws and requlations.

Compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such overage may not be sufficient.

We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations. there las been an increase in criminal evber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and data, including those we maintain with our third-party service providers, have been subject to cyber security breaches to yber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information system service risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties' information security operations. A significant theft, loss of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations, and result in remediation expensive and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to risks related to corporation. Many factors influence our reputation. Many factors of our brands including the perception held by our customers, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in seversity and inclusion, community engagement and philanthropy, environmental sustainability, plastic pollution, climate change, responsible gaming, supply chain management, workplace conduct, human rights, and many others, some of which may be unforeseen. Any harm to our reputation could further impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to risks and costs related to climate change. Extreme weather conditions, potentially exacerbated by climate change, may cause property damage or interrupt business which our business and results of operations. Certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurrivanes, wildfires, and winter storms in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau. Such extreme weather conditions may internet of critical suppliers, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations or the operations of critical suppliers could be adversely in other cause of water stress or shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate or source critical supplies could adversely affect our business. Although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage weather onditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we camot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from sucher conditions.

Furthermore, such extreme weather conditin reduced availability or increased price volatility of certain critical supplies, may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties, and may cause visits to decrease for an indefinite period. Additionally, many states and municipalities have begun to adopt laws and emission reduction reduction targes. Changes in federal, state, and local legislation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased regulatory costs, which may include capital expenditures on our existing properties to ensure compliance with any new or undations, which may potentially adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the potential impacts of climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, results of operations, cash flows or business.

Water scarcity could negatively impact our operations. Water is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems in which we operate. Water is also a limited resource in may parts of the world, including Las Vegas where the majority of our properties are located. Water availability is facing unprecedented chalten, the effects of climate change, and increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require water.

the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laws, including the Bank Secreey Act, or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread. See "—The elobal COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liguidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time." In addemicrelated restrictions that resulted in the temporary closures of our properties during 2020, governmental or other convincions have been extended or reimposed from time-to-time and new restrictions may be imposed in the future.

Any violation of the Foreign Cornupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us. Historically, a significant portion of our revenue was derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Pactices Act ("FCPA") and other similar laws, which generally prohibit companies and their internediaries from mans to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penaties against us, and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the FCPA. The ocurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected. Federal, state and local authorities dometically raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees, including taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming or other taxes or changes to tax laws that result in increased taxes to us. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were taxes, impose new taxes or change existing tax laws, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change naterially in future periods. We currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that are available to potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods, including the recapture of overall domestic losses to the extent of U.S. taxable income per year. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. This evaluation is based on all available evidence, including assumptions oncerning profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assult in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the period including such change.

We face risks related to pending claims that have be, brought against us. Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition, results of operation. Please see the further discussion in "Legal Proceedings" and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

#### Risks Related to Our Macau Operations

The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact MGM China's business, and liquidity, and such inpact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time. Our properties in Macau were open during the first half of 2022, however, gaming operations were temporarily suspended on July 11, 2022 due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Macau and resumed on July 23, 2022, subject to certain continuing health safeguards. On October 30, 2022, a COVID-19 case was identified as connected to MGM Cotai. All guests and staff were isolated until November 1, 2022 and all gaming, hotel, restaurant, and retail operations were suspended with limited operations expected to resume beginning November 3, 2022. More broadly, electronic applications for individual and group travel visas to Macau resumed on November 1, 2022, however, certain travel and entry restrictions in Macau and mainland China remained in place at the time, including COVID-19 testing and certain quarantine requiremently impacted visitation to our Macau properties. Beginning in

{31}------------------------------------------------

December 2022, Macau and mainland China started unwinding testing and quarantine requirements as well as travel and entry restrictions associated with the "dynamic zero" COVID-19 policy. On Ianuary 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid in place until February 6, 2023 when all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. Although COVID-19 measures have not been reimplemented to date, the extent and timing of further closures of MGM China's properties, limitations of operations, or whether travel restrictions to or from Macau will be reimplemented is uncertain if there is an increase or continued spread of COVID-19.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and new variants continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess. In addition, we may also face unforesen liability or be subject to additional obligations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of claims alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connections or facilities or to the extent we are subject to a governmental enforcement action as a result of health and safety compliance. As a result of the ultimate scope. duration and impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, but it may continue to our business. financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and stock price.

We have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China. In connection with the gaming concession, we entered into a Third Renewed Deed of Non-Compte Undertakings with MGM China and Ms. Ho, Pansy Catlina Chiu King ("Ms. Ho"), pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People's Republic of China. Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other through MGM China, While gaming is currently prohibited in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) the date MGM China's ordinary shares cease to be listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Limited or (i) the last day of MGM Grand Paradise's concession for operation of cany extension thereof); or (ii) the date when our ownership of MGM China shares is less than 15% of the then-issued share capital of MGM China.

The Macau government can (i) terminate MGM Grand Paradise's concession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise, (i) from the eighth year of MGM Grand Paradise's concession, redeem the concession by providing MGM Grand Paradise at least one year's prior notice and subject to the payment of reasonable and fair damages or indemnity to MGM Grand Paradise, or (ii) refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise on extension in 2032. The Maca government has the right to unilaterally terminate the concession for endangering the national securty of China or Macau by MGM Grand Paradise to perform its obligations, for the public interest or lack of appropriate qualifications of MGM Grand Paring law. From the eighth year of MGM Grand Paradise's concession, the Macar government may redeem the concession by providing MGM Grand Paradise with at least one year of advance notice. In the event the Macau government exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand is entitled to reasonable and fair damages or indemnity. all of MGM Grand Paradise's casino area premises and gaming-related equipment, with the exception of those which have been temporarily transferred to MGM Grand Paradise by the Macau government for use in accordance with the concession contract, would be transferred automatically to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations under the concession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.

Under the terms of MGM Grand Paradise's concession, MGM Grand Paradise is required to implement sin gaming and non-gaming projects, with a committed investment amount of MOP 16.7 billion (approximately \$2.1 billion as of December 31, 2022), of which MOP 15 billion (approximately \$1.9 billion as of December 31, 2022) is in non-gaming projects, and which is subject to increases of up to 20% in future years in the event that macu annual gross gaming revenue reaches MOP 180 billion (appoximately \$22,4 billion as of December 31, 2022). There can be no assurance, that MGM Grand Paradise will have sufficient cash on hand to fund these obligations, or that it will be able to obtain financing to find these obligations on at all. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to satisfy its investment commitments, its concession contract may be subject to termination by the Macau government.

Furthermore, under the concession contract, MGM Grand to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau government might promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or other requirements of MGM Grand Paradise's concession contract, or that these laws and regulations or other requirements would not adversely affect our ability to construct or Macau businesses. If any disagreement arises between MGM Grand the Macau government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise's compliance with, a provision of the concession contract, MGM Grand Paradise will be relying on a consultation process with the Macau government. During any consultation or negotiation, MGM Grand Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the concession contract as interpreted by the Macau government. Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the Macau government will treat the termination of a concession upon the 

{32}------------------------------------------------

circumstances mentioned above. The concession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in Macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, the concession contract expires on December 31, 2032. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to obtain an extension of the concession contract upon its expiration or be awarded a new gaming concession on terms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. We cannot provide any assurated with any potential future extension, which could include additional fees or other financial commitments that may have an adverse impact on the financial position of MGM Grand Parade you that if the concession is redeemed by the Macau government, the compensation paid to MGM Grand Parante for the loss of future revenues.

We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs, In particular, the risks associated with the operation of MGM China or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:

- . changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;
- . changes in non-United States government programs;
- . possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;
- general economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements; .
- . difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;
- . different labor regulations;
- . changes in environmental, health and safety laws;
- outbreaks of diseases or epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; .
- . potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
- o political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;
- . economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and
- . uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.

These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are also exposed to a variety of market risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the United States dollar strengthens in relation to the countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease.

Conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors of MGM China, the holding company for MGM Grand Paradise which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotal. As a result of the initial public offering of shares of MGM China common stock in 2011, MGM China has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of MGM China may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of MGM China. Decisions that could have different implications for us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM China, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.

#### ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fissal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 25, 2022.

#### Description of our business and key performance indicators

Our primary business is the operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We operate several of the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generating cash flow to pay rent, fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, repay debt financings, and return capital to our shareholders. We lease of our domestic resorts pursuant to triple-net lease agreements and make significant in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenties. We also offer online gaming and sports betting through Leo Vegas, our consolidated subsidiary, as well as through BetMGM, our unconsolidated affiliate.

Our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue to be focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or results. Our results will also depend upon our ability to expand our ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for ifaming and online sports betting.

#### Impact of COVID-19

The spread of COVID-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2020, 2021 and may continue to impact our business thereafter. In March 2020, all of our domestic properties were temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, all of our properties that were temporarily closed re-opened to the public, with temporary re-closures and re-openings ocurring for certain of our properties or portions the first quarter of 2021. Upon re-opening, the properties continued to operate without certain amenties and subject to certain occupancy limitations varying by jurisdiction. Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, our domestic jurisdictions eased and removed prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies. As of December properties were open and not subject to operating restrictions; however, travel and business volume were negatively affected in the first quarter of 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant.

In Macau, following a temporary closure of our properties on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain health safeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bass, temperature checking. The issuance of tourist visas (including the individual visit scheme) for residents of Zhuhai, Guangdong Provinces in mainland China to travel to Macau resumed on August 12, 2020, August 26, 2020 and September 23, 2020, respectively, however several travel and entry restrictions in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China remained in place (including the temporary suspension of ferry services between Hong Kong and Macau, the negative nucleic acid test result certificate,

Our normal table games hold Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-Baccarat; however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause volatility in our hold percentages; and
- . Hotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts): hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ("ADR," a price indicator); and revenue per available room ("REVPAR," a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of ocupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. Rooms that were out of service during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as a result of property closures due to the pandemic were excluded from the available room count when calculating hotel occupancy and REVPAR.

Additional key performance indicators at MGM China are:

- . Gaming revenue indicators: MGM China utilizes "turnover," which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by MGM China calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. Turnover provides a basis for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.6% to 3.3% of turnover, however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the pandemic could cause volatility in MGM China's hold percentages.

In June 2021, CityCenter closed the sale of its Harnon land, for which we recorded a \$50 million gain within our share of operating income from unconsolidated affiliates.

In September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in CityCenter and now own 100% of the equity interest in CityCenter. Accordingly, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements.

In April 2022, we completed the VICI Transaction pursuant to which the assets and liabilities of MGP were derecognized, which included MGP OP's investment in the VICI BREIT Venture.

Gross interest expense was \$596 million in 2022 compared to \$800 million in 2021. The decrease from the prior year period is due primarily to a decrease in debt outstanding as a result of the derecognition of MGP OP's senior notes in connection with the deconsolidation of MGP, partially offiset by an increase in the debt outstanding under MGM China's revolving credit facilities.

Our effective rate for 2022 was unfavorably impacted by losses in Macau that we could not benefit and an increase in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the New Jersey income, partially offset by a decrease in Macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from the acceleration of amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession and the exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax to the year as well as the impact of a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the VICI Transation. Our effective rate for 2021 was favorably impacted by the permanent exclusion of the gam on consolidation of CityCenter, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of losses in Macau that we could not benefit.

Cash taxes paid decreased in 2022 comparily due to refinds received from caryback claims related to losses incurred in 2020.

#### Reportable Segment GAAP measure

"Adjusted Property EBITDAR" is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as eamings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, restructuring costs (which represents costs related stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense related to triple-net operating leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estates gain on consolidation of City Center, net, gain related to City Center's sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, corporate expense (which includes CEO transition expense and October 1 litigation settlement) and stock compensation expense, which are not and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation. We manage capital allocation, tax planning, stock compensation, and financing decisions at the corporate level. "Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin" is Adjusted by related segment net revenues.

#### Non-GAAP Measures

"Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR" is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating segments from the beginning period through the date of disposition. Accordingly, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022, Aria for periods subsequent to its acquisition on September 27, 2021, and The Mirage for to its disposition on December 19, 2022 in Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR for the periods indicated, as applicable.

{47}------------------------------------------------

Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP mesure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period comparisons of the results of our operations for operating segments that were consolidated for the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance. considered in isolation, or as an alternative to our reportable segment GAAP measure or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may not by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial messures of other ences may be material. A reconciliation of our reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included herein.

"Adjusted EBITDAR" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, CEO transition expense, October 1 litigation settlement, restructuring costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, gain relater's sale of Harnon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.

Adjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disrevarded in evaluation of our earnings verformance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trens may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and imparment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period. In addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense reasing leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders when valuing us, as well as companing our results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since ther gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of our performance, considered in an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because is not presented on a GAAP bass and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to our triple-net operating leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBTDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different may be material. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, triple-net lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR is included herein.

#### Cash Flows

Operating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was \$1.8 billion in 2022 compared to \$1.4 billion in 2021. The change from the prior year was an Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations discussed within the Results of Operations section above and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments.

Investing activities. Our investing cash fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing or dispositions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expendrumestments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.

Cash provided by investing activities was \$2.1 billion in 2021. In 2021. In 2021. In 2022, we received \$4.4 billion in net cash proceeds related to the VICI Transaction and \$1.1 billion in net cash proceeds related to the Mirage, which were partially offset by cash paid of \$1.6 billion to acquired, cash acquired, cash paid of \$279 million in connection with the LeoVegas tender offer, net of cash acquired, cash paid of \$183 million to acquire shares of LeoVegas in the open market during the tender offer period, payments of \$765 million in capital expend below, contributions of \$225 million to our unconsolidated affiliate, BetMGM, and \$282 million in net investments in the prior year period, we received we received \$3.9 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the real estate of Aria and Vdara, received \$107 million in net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. primarily related to the sale of art, which were partially offset by our payments of \$1.8 billion to acquired, \$491 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and contributions of \$225 million to BetMGM.

#### Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management's discussion and analysis of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated finance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates and assumptions involve both a significant level of estimation uncertanty due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to acount for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change is high and are had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree actual results can differ from our estimates.

#### Loss Reserve for Casino Receivables

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our other casinos do not emplasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to those corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agences and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of entorceability, among other factors, when we issue resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates credit.

We maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. Expected credit losses, increases the loss reserve. We regularly evaluate the lossino accounts, which involves judgments and assumptions about realizability, curent and expected future economic conditions in various geographies, and business conditions. At domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the loss reserve is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which is supported by ongoing evaluation of relevant historical and any other known information such as the current economic conditions that could drive losses. At domesic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer's current and expected future financial condition, collection history, and current and expected future economic conditions. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account, the financial condition and the collection history of the customer. Approximately \$54 million of casino receivables and \$25 million and \$31 million of the loss reserve for casino receivables relate to MGM China at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables:

|                                                            | December 31,   |  |         |  |  |  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--|---------|--|--|--|
|                                                            | 2022           |  |         |  |  |  |
|                                                            | (In thousands) |  |         |  |  |  |
| Casino receivables                                         | 500,986        |  | 380,907 |  |  |  |
| Loss reserve for casino accounts receivable                | 97.929         |  | 117.539 |  |  |  |
| Loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable | 20 %           |  | 31 %    |  |  |  |

The loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in the current year primarily due to a decrease in the age of outstanding receivables. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the loss can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes in economic conditions ocur. At December 31, 2022, a 100 basis-point change in the loss reservables would change income before income taxes by \$5 million.

#### Fixed Asset Capitalization

Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the property

{53}------------------------------------------------

nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. When we construct asses, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries.

We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditure is considered a maintenance expense, or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assess are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar asses, engineering studies, and our estimate of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

#### Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commiss to a plan to sell the aset at a reasonable price in relue and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as beld for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be review for imparment whenever indicators of imparment exist. We then compare the estimated future of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no imparment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the asset. For operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby fiture cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized imparment losses, whether for assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assess must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actually from our estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset grow, including potential sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.

We review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment test for intentible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal vear. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. For our 2022 annual impairment tests, we utilized the operform a qualitative ("\$tep zero") analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge.

We review goodwill at least annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2022 annual impairment tests, we either utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin or we elected to perform a quantitative analysis and the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin. There are several estimates in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results materially from our estimates. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates used in the imparmpat 

{54}------------------------------------------------

tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions or events outside of our control. The value of our Empire City reporting unit is dependent upon us obtaining a commercial gaming thereof, as well as other assumptions that may change throughout the biddinal information becomes known, which includes the size, scope, and timing of constructing an expanded facility, the potential for and timing of a transaction of the improvements and the proceeds and any rent associated with such transaction, and flows generated by the expanded facility, such as license payments and other payments to government entitles, gaming tax and forecasted revenue and expenses from operations. While the quantitative impartment analysis performed in 2022 resulted in the fair value of Empire City exceeding its carrying value by a substantial margin based upon the assumptions as of the date of the analysis, any of these assumptions coult of new or additional information and, if they do, could result in an impairment of up to the full amount of the reporting unit's goodwill of \$256 million.

See Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

#### Long-lived assets - MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession

In connection with the enactment of the new Macau gaming law in June 2022, that provides for the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including and prohibiting gaming subsequent to their expiration, which occurred on December 31, 2022, and provided for other material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under new gaming concessions, we determined that MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession are two separate units of account.

Further, as the material changes in the legal and regulatory environment could have had an adverse effect on the value of MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession, we concluded that a trigger event had occurred in June 2022 for the MGM China asset group. The gaming subconcession was an entity-wide asset of MGM China as the benefit of the right to conduct gaming subconcession was shared by each of MGM China's casino resorts and the gaming subconcession cannot be separated from the casino resorts in which gaming operations are conducted. We determined that the primary asset of the asset group as the real estate component generates a significant portion of the entity's cash flows through gaming operations conducted at its cash oresorts. Accordingly, cash flows were projected over the remaining useful life of the real estate, including cash flows from gaming oneliscounted cash flows of the asset group significantly exceeded the carrying value; accordingly, no impairment was indicated.

There were several estimates inherent in evaluating the gaming subconcession asset for impairment. The asse group to be tested for recoverability and the primary asset of the asset group are matters of judgment on corporate structure, the legal and regulatory environment in which the entity operates, and the level of interdependency between assets used in revenue generating activities. The determination of the primary asset directly affects the period over which cash flows are forming the recoverability test. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nay differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of undiscounted cash flows used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent of land concession renewals and successfully obtaining a gaming concession with future public tenders.

Additionally, we reassessed the useful life of the gaming subconcession intangible asset and, given the resulting changes described above, we determined that the useful life would no longer be based on the MGM Cotai land concession that ends in January 2038, and that the new useful life is consistent with the remaining contractual term of the existing gaming subconcesson, which ended on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was recognized on a straight-ine basis over its reduced useful life, thereby accelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations.

The determination of the unit of account and useful life of the gaming subconcession are based upon facts and circumstances as of a point in time and may change as such conditions develop, evolve, or change. We have determined the unit of account and useful life based upon the final gaming law and is enactment in June 2022 as the enalization of the changes in legal form and rights and obligations related to gaming concessions in Macau.

#### ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

#### Market Risk

In addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash finstruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the debt matures. We do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.

As of December 31, 2022, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 17% of our total borrowings. The following table provides additional information about the maturities of our debt subject to changes in interest rates:

|                       |   | Debt maturing in |    |       |   |       |   |              |   |                                     |   |       |       | Fair Value<br>December 31, |      |       |

In addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related on changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong do the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong dollar will remain at the same level. The possible changes to the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. For U.S. dollar denominated debt incurred by MGM China, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, a 1% weakening of the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of \$28 million.

#### The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas acquisition - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements

#### Critical Audit Matter Description

On May 17, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for cash consideration of \$1.625 billion plus working capital adjustments for a total purchase price of approximately \$1.7 billion. The Company recognized 100% of the aquired assumed liabilities at fair value at the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired in the transaction. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based on significant inputs that intentible assets include \$130 million of trademarks, which is an intangible asset, and \$95 million of customer lists, which is amortized 

{60}------------------------------------------------

over its estimated useful life of seven years. Goodwill of \$1.3 billion was recognized as the excess of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The fair value determination of the trademer lists required management to make significant estimates and assumptions around expected cash flows and projected financial results, including forecasted revenues and expenses (collectively the "forecas"), as well as the selection of discount rates. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a significant impact on the trademarks, the customer list, and the recognition of goodwill. Therefore, auditing the forecast and the degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity, as well as an increased level of audit effort, including the involvement of fair value specialists.

## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the forecast and selection of discount rates used by management to determine the aquired intangible assets and the reporting unit assigned goodwill included the following, among others:

- . We tested the effectiveness of controls over determining the tradename and customer list, including those over management's forecast and the selection of discount rates.
- o We evaluated the assumptions and estimates included in the forecast by:
	- Comparing the forecasts to information included in the Company's communications to the Board of Directors, earnings and press releases, gaming industry reports, investor presentations, and analyst reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies:
	- o Comparing the forecasts to historical financial results;
	- Conducting inquiries with management; and o
	- o Evaluating whether the forecast was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.
- . With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:
	- Testing the market-based source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the discount rate calculations.
	- o Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

#### MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements

#### Critical Audit Matter Description

Pursuant to the agreement dated April 19, 2005 between MGM Grand S.A., a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate of chance and other casino games. On June 23, 2022, MGM Grand Paradise entered into an addendum to its subconcession was extended to December 31, 2022. Further, a new gaming law was approved by the Macau Legislative Assembly on June 21, 2022. Under the new gaming law, the existing subconcessions were discontinued and a maximum of six concessions were to be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain exceptional circumstances.

The enactment of the new Macau gaming law in June 2022 provides for the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subsequent to their expiration, and also includes material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions. As a result, the Company determined that the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession and new gaming concession are two separate units of account. Additionally, in June 2022, the Company reassessed the useful life of the gaming subconcession intangible asset and determined that, given the resulting changes described above, the useful life would no longer be based on the MGM Cotai land concession, which ends in January 2038, and that the useful life should be revised to align with the cessation of the subconcession rights, which ended on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was recognized on a straight-line basis over its reduced useful life. The gaming subconcession was fully amortized as of December 31, 2022.

We identified the determination of the unit of account and the useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset as a critical audit matter because the accounting Standard Codfication ("ASC") 350-30, Intangbles-Goodwill and Other: General Intangibles Other than Goodwill, involved challenging, subjective, and complex judgments. Therefore, anditing this matter, involved a higher degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity, including the involvement of specialists.

{61}------------------------------------------------

#### How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the determination of the unit of account and the revision of the useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset included the following, among others:

- . We tested the effectiveness of the controls over management's assessment of the unit of account, management's application of the accounting guidance in ASC 350-30, the revision of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset, and the calculation of the accelerated amortization expense.
- . We inspected the new gaming law which was approved in June 2022 and the underlying agreements related to the subconcession and subsequent extensions. With the assistance of technical accounting specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management's application of the accounting guidance in ASC 350-30 and the judgments used by management to determine the unit of account and the revision of the useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset.
- . We recalculated the accelerated amortization expense from June 21, 2022 based on the revision of the useful life.

#### NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation. The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. The Company may change its original assessment of a VE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity's equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.

The venture (the "Bellagio BREIT Venture") that is 5% owned by a subsidiary of the Company and 95% owned by a subsidiary of BREIT is a VIE because the equity holders as a group larough voting or similar rights to direct the activites of such entity that most

{70}------------------------------------------------

significantly impact such entity's economic performance. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of Bellagio BREIT Venture because the Company does not have power to direct that could potentially be significant to the venture as BREIT, as the managing member, has such power; accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the venture. The Company's maximum exposure to loss in Bellagio BRE/T Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment of \$56 million as of December 31, 2022, assuming no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the company's guarantee of the debt of Bellagio BREIT Venture, which guarantee is immaterial as of December 31, 2022, as further discussed in Note 12.

For entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial interest based upon the respective entities' ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If the entity does not qualition under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the Company generally accounts for the entity under the equiry method, such as BetMGM, which does not qualify for consolidation as the Company has joint control, given the entity is structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate in the decision making process, which prevents the Company from exerting a controlling financial interest in such entry, as defined in ASC 810. For entities over which the Company does not have significant influence, such as VICI OP, the Company accounts for its equity investment under ASC 321.

Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period presentation.

Management's use of estimates. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and disclosure of contingent asses and liabilities at the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Company's accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates or equired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value measurements also affect the Company's accounting for certain of its financial asses and itabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according that includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market: Level 2 inputs, which are quoted prices for identical or comparable instruments or pricing using observable market data; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:

- . Level 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments recorded at fair value;
- . Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9;
- . Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its debt investments; and
- Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs when of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions. See Note 4. .

Equity investments. Fair value is measured based upon trading prices on the applicable securities exchange for equity investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 825, such as LeoVegas (prior to consolidation), and equity investments accounted for under ASC 321 that have a readly determinable fair value such as VICI OP. The fair value of these investments was \$461 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is reflected within "Other long-term assets, net' on the consolidated balance shees. Gains and losses are recorded in "Other, net" in the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 the Company recorded a net gain on its equity investments of \$10 million, respectively,

Debt investments. The Company's investments in debt securites are classified as trading securites and recorded at fair value. Gains and losses are recorded in "Other, net" in the statement of operations. Debt securities are considered if the criteria for such classification is met or otherwise classified as short-term investments within "Prepaid expenses and other" since the investment of cash is available for current operations.

Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents investments and interest-bearing instruments that are highly liquid with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition. Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company's cash management program are recorded within "Accounts and construction payable."

Restricted cash. Cash held in an escrow account related to the reverse termination fee that was contractually required for The Cosmopolitan acquisition was reflected as "Restricted Cash" on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. "Restricted Cash" and "Cash and cash equivalents" on the consolidated balance sheets equivalents, and restricted cash" on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2021. MGM China's pledged cash of \$124 million securing the bank guarantees discussed in Note 12 is restricted in use and classified within "Other long-term assets, net." Such and cash equivalents" on the consolidated balance sheets equal "Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash" on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2022.

Accounts receivable and credit risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino receivables. The Company issues credit following background checks and investigations of credityorthiness. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 52%, respectively, of the Company's gross accounts receivable related to casino receivables.

Accounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are received. An estimated loss reserve is maintained to reduce the Company's receivables to their net carrying amount. The loss reserve is estimated based on both a specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current and business onditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2022, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which a loss reserve had not already been recorded.

Inventories. Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined primarily using the average cost method for food and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method.

Property and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company's property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains of property and equipment are included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Property and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:

| Buildings and improvements | 15 to 40 years |
|----------------------------|----------------|
| Land improvements          | 10 to 20 years |
| Furniture and fixtures     | 3 to 20 years  |
| Equipment                  | 3 to 15 years  |

{72}------------------------------------------------

The Company evaluates its property and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset a reasonable price in relation to its actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, the Company reviewer indicators of impairment exist. The Company the estimated future cash flows of the asset group, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value. no impairment is indicated cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, fiture cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

In connection with the expration of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession on December 31, 2022, the casino areas of MGM Cotai and MGM Macau reverted, free of charge and without any encumbrances, to the Macau government, which is now the legal owner of the reverted gaming assets. On January 1, 2023 and in commencement of the gaming concession, the gaming assets were temporarily transferred to MGM Grand Paradise for the gaming concession in return for annual payments. As the Company will continue to operate the gaming assets in the same manner as under the gaming subconcession, obtain substantially all of the economic benefits, and bear all of the risks arising from the economic life of the assets as the Company assumes it will be successful in the awarding of a new concession at the end of the company will continue to recognize the reverted gaming assets within "Property and equipment" and depreciate the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives.

Capitalized interest. The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized in the cost of the project. When no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on the project using the weighted average cost of the Company's outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. The Company has investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the investes' earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences, as well as captal contributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of necorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and impairments related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of operating income or loss and classifies income or losses related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of none or loss, as the Company's investments in such unconsolidated affiliates are an extension of the Company's core business operations.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value of its investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determinent is indicated and determines whether the impairment is "other-than-temporary" based on its assessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company's intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company's peer group.

Goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of trademarks and certain of our gaming livenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No material impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Accounting guidance provides entities the option a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assess (commonly referred to as "step zero") in order to determine whether impairment testing is necessary. In performing the step zero analysis the Company considers macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entityspecific events, and changes in the composition or carrying anits for goodwill. In addition, the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well

Company is not the controlling entity, which primarily include certainment shows and, in certain jurisdictions, the Company's arrangement with BetMGM for online sports betting and iGaming.

The Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings with hotel stays and convention services. Tor such arrangements, the Company allocates review based on its relative SSP. The Company primarily determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers.

Contract and Contract-Related Liabilities. There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue, resulting in a contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations, which represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs ("casino front money") and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided such as advance ticket sales and convention space or for unpaid wagers. These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within "Other accrued liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets.

Costs reimbursed pursuant to management services are recognized as revenue it incurs the costs as this reflects when the Company performs its related performance obligation and is entitled to reinbursed costs related primarily to the Company's management of CityCenter (such management was terminated upon the acquisition of CityCenter in September 2021).

Revenue by source. The Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 17.

Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.

The Company classifies a lease with terms greater than twelve months as either operating or finance. At commencement, the right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The initial measurement of ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, such as for the Company's triple-net operating leases for which the lessor has provided the assumptions required for the Company to rate implicit in the lease, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Company's leases, such as its ground subleases and quinment leases, the Company cannot readily determine the implicit rate. Accordingly the Company ate to discount the lease payments for such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Company's triple-net operating leases each contain renewal periods at the Company's option, each of which are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. Many of the Company's leases include fixed rental escalation clauses that are factored into the determination of lease payments. For operating lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line base over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the ROU asset and the lease interest based on the interest method using the discount rate determined at

Such distributions are accued each quarter and are paid 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. The notcontrolling interest parties each have the ability to require MGM Nation to purchase all or a portion of their interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula.

The Company has recorded the interests as "Redeemable noncontrolling interests" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and not stockholders' equity because their redemption is not exclusively in the interests were initially accounted for at fair value. Subsequently, the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests to equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company records any changes caused by such an excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is adjusted for accrued annual preferred distributions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Gold Strike Tunica. On February 15, 2023, the Company completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of \$450 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments.

MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession. As described in Note 1, the new Macau gaming law in June 2022 provided for material changes to the legal form of gaming oncessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessons subsequent to their expiration, and also included material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions. As a result, the Company determined that the MGM Grand se gaming subconcession and new gaming concession are two separate units of account.

Further, as the material changes in the legal and requlatory environment could have an adverse effect on the value of MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred under ASC 360 in June 2022 for the MGM China asset group. The Company compared the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the carrying value and determined that the undiscounted cash flows significantly exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, no impairment was indicated.

Additionally, in June 2022, the Company reassessed the useful life of the gaming subconcession intangible asset and determined that, given the new gaming law and the resulting changes described above, the useful life would no longer be based on the initial term of the MGM Cotai land concession, which ends in January 2038, and that the useful life should be revised to align with the cessation of the subconcession rights that occurred at the end of the contractual term of the gaming subconcession, which ended on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession a straight-line basis over its reduced useful life. The gaming subconcession was fully amortized as of December 31, 2022.

Amortization expense related to intangible assets was \$2.7 billion and \$194 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, estimated future amortization is as follows:

The Company has recorded a valuation allowarce of \$2.6 billion on its foreign tax credit ("FTC") carryover of \$2.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, resulting in an FTC net deferred tax asset of approximately \$130 million. The Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. While the Company generate new FTC carryovers after the year ended December 31, 2017, it will be able to utilize its extent it has active foreign source income during the 10year FTC carryforward period. Such foreign source includes the recapture, to the extent of a portion of U.S. taxable income each year, of overall domestic losses that totaled approximately \$356 million at December 31, 2022. The Company relies on future U.S. source operating income in assessing utilization of the overall dosses and, by extension, future FTC realization during the 10-year FTC carryover period. The FTC carryovers will expire if not utilized as follows: \$976 million in 2024; \$674 million in 2025; \$134 million in 2026; and \$200 million in 2027.

The Company's assessment of the realization of its FTC deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions concerning tuture U.S. operating profits and foreign source in result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to such assumptions could result in a material change with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change.

MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits through December 31, 2022, concurrent with the end of the term of its gaming subconcession. Absent the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits, "Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International" would have increased by S3 million in 2022 and decreased by \$10 million in 2021 and diluted earnings per share would have increased by \$0.01 in 2021. The Company continues to assume that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau 12% on gaming grofits for all periods beyond December 31, 2022 and has factored that assumption into the measurement of Macau deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Non-gaming operations remain subject to the Macau complementary tax. At December 31, 2022, foreign net operating loss carry forwards primarily consisted of a complementary tax NOL carryforward of \$1.6 billion at MGM Grand Parations from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized in years 2023 through 2025.

MGM Grand Paradise's exemption from the 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to MGM China. Through the year ended December 31, 2022, in lieu of the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its shareholder. MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits, MGM Grand Paradise agreed to pay a flat annual payment of approximately \$2 million regardless of the amount of distributable dividends.

There is a \$245 million valuation allowance on certain foreign deferred tax assets, which primarily relates to Macau deferred tax assets at MGM Grand Paradise. The valuation allowance on Macau deferred tax assets increased by \$89 million during 2022 as a result of accelerating amortization for the remaining useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession.

The Company has NOLs in some of the states in which it operates that total \$373 million as of December to deferred tax assets of \$23 million after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance. The NOL carryforwards in most of the states will expire, if not utilized, between 2025 through 2041. Otherwise, the NOL carryforward indefinitely. The Company has provided a valuation allowance of \$8 million on some of its state deferred tax assets for the NOLs described above.
