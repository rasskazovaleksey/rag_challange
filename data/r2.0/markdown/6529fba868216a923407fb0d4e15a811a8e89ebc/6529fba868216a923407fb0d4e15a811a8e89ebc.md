# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**WHO WE ARE**

IPL is a leading supplier to the resources and agricultural sectors. With a team of just over 5800 dedicated employees, we have a strong safety culture that we're committed to building on. With iconic brands, leading technology solutions and great customers, we operate in the resilient markets of agriculture, mining and quarry and construction. And of course, we are committed to a sustainable and decarbonised world.

An ASX100 company, IPL has two customer facing businesses, **Dyno Nobe**l based in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific and **Incitec Pivot Fertilisers**, a leading integrated manufacturer and distributor of fertilisers across the east coast of Australia. We are an international business with world-scale explosives and fertiliser manufacturing, leading technology solutions, marketing and servicing operations. We are proud to be considered a trusted partner by customers and suppliers.

Our explosives are used to unlock resources ranging from gold, iron ore and copper, to quarry and construction materials. Those resources contribute to new technologies, such as electric vehicles and wind turbines, and critical infrastructure. Our fertiliser products play an important role in enabling sustainable food production to meet the rapidly rising demand for food around the world.

With a rich technology heritage, IPL's key technology drivers are to improve safety, productivity & efficiency, and sustainability. And we continue to invest in the development of new technologies and our service offering.

We have an ambition to reach Net Zero operational emissions by 2050, or sooner if practicable. Our climate change management strategy is focused on four key pillars:

- 1. Ensuring strong governance;
- 2. Reducing operational emissions;
- 3. Delivering products and strategies that reduce Scope 3 emissions; and
- 4. Managing strategic business risks and opportunities.

Our Net Zero Pathway shows the key enablers and technologies required to reduce our emissions, along with the expected timeframe for each.

### **Global footprint**

Serving high quality customers with technological solutions across six continents, including Australia, North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa, we manufacture ammonium nitratebased explosives and initiating systems, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, and nitrogen related industrial and specialty chemicals. We have major manufacturing sites across Australia and the US, with key sites in Cheyenne (Wyoming, USA), Louisiana (Missouri, USA), Waggaman (Louisiana, USA), Moranbah (QLD, Australia), Geelong (VIC, Australia) and Phosphate Hill (QLD, Australia).

Further strengthening each business are a number of key investments. The acquisition of **Titanobel** – a leading French industrial explosives manufacturer – allows the Dyno Nobel business to leverage its technology into new and profitable markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa. The Incitec Pivot Fertilisers business has acquired a majority stake in **Australian Bio Fert Pty Ltd (ABF)**, with plans to develop and deliver a new category of sustainable fertilisers. And finally, our **Easy Liquids** (formerly Yara Nipro) acquisition will enable IPF to better serve customers through a strengthened storage and distribution network and improve security of supply of a diverse range of liquid products for dealers, agents, and agronomists.

### **Dyno Nobel**

### **Delivering advanced technology through practical innovation**

**Dyno Nobel** is IPL's international explosives and technical blasting services business and one of the largest industrial explosives distributors in North America and Australia. Blasting is an essential step in extracting the minerals required to meet the world's demand for power, infrastructure and consumer goods. Construction, mines, quarries and seismic explorers use Dyno Nobel products to achieve safety goals and improve operational efficiency.

We provide a full range of reliable explosives products from manufacturing plants around the world and extensive blasting services. In fact, we boast some of the most highly trained blasters and technical experts in the industry, and operate in Australia, Canada, the United States, Indonesia, Mexico, Chile, Papua New Guinea, Turkey and France. Our research & development focuses on practical ways to use new technologies to benefit our customers and include **DIFFERENTIAL ENERGY® ,DigiShot® Plus.4G** and **CyberDet® I (1)**.

### **Incitec Pivot Fertilisers**

### **Trusted partner in soil health**

As a leading fertiliser manufacturer and distributor on the east coast of Australia, Incitec Pivot Fertilisers is on a journey to become the nation's leading soil health business. Our people, products and services support farming communities and contribute to our growers' production, which in turn helps feed millions around the globe. Resilient, diverse and proud, we are driven by science, innovation and maximising soil potential. Through our comprehensive "Agronomy in Practice" training course we help educate and develop the capability of Australian agronomists. Using an interactive and engaging program with hands-on activities and assessments at every step of the way, it's the ultimate course in best practice soil, plant tissue and water sampling, testing, interpreting analysis results and making fertiliser recommendations.

Incitec Pivot Fertiliser's leading brands include **Granulock®**, **SuPerfect®** and our patented de-nitrification inhibitor **eNpower®**. With a dedicated network of suppliers and agents across the east coast of Australia, as well as our NATA-accredited **Nutrient Advantage® Laboratory**, Incitec Pivot Fertilisers supports farmers with the crop nutrition insights and products they need to maximise yield potential in an efficient way. Further afield, through our global trading business Southern Cross Fertilisers, we sell and trade in major offshore agricultural markets including **Asia Pacific**, the **Indian subcontinent**, the **United States**, **Latin America** and other international locations.

### **The future looks different**

The way we operate at IPL and what our customers want from us, has changed. It is being driven by the increasing importance of food security and mining extraction for the world's future, as well as the global trend in decarbonisation. With a clear opportunity to accelerate our growth through the development of technology and customer solutions, we can capitalise on the significant potential in the mining and agricultural sectors.

And this is why in May 2022 we announced our demerger proposal, with the intention to create two market leading companies. Under this proposal, Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers will each have a dedicated purpose, vision and leadership. With technology solutions and prioritised capital allocation, each company will have the opportunity to accelerate its growth ambitions. This will help drive value for shareholders, and better serve our customers, employees and the communities in which they operate. The demerger will enable each business to create focussed solutions to meet GHG emission reduction targets, and to assist their direct and indirect customers in achieving their own net zero ambitions.

Building on impressive one-hundred-year histories, there is a clear and compelling path for Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers to thrive as two independent companies. To be trusted partners delivering technology-driven solutions to customers. The demerger is subject to final Board approval, shareholder and other third-party approvals.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>**IPL STRATEGY SNAPSHOT**

At the heart of our IPL strategy, we strive to be a **safe**, **efficient** and **industry leading** company.

This means we want to be an industry leader for our safety performance. We go further by actively shaping the safety performance of the industries in which we operate. **Efficient** is having a sound operating model that is simple and enables our people to be their very best and deliver on our strategy. We want the most **talented workforce**, who are proud to call us their employer.

Our strategy is underpinned by six drivers and these direct our focus, effort and resources. The activities – necessary to deliver our strategy – are expressed as yearly milestones. And of course, bringing our strategy to life, relies on our people living **our values** every day, in every way.

We have an ambition to reach Net Zero operational emissions by 2050, or as soon as practicable. Our climate change management strategy is focused on four key pillars: 1. Ensuring strong governance 2. Reducing operational emissions 3. Delivering products & strategies that reduce Scope 3 emissions and 4. Managing strategic business risks & opportunities.

### **Key business announcements & highlights**

| Future looks<br>different                                          | IPL's demerger proposal, with the intention to create two market leading companies in Dyno Nobel and<br>Incitec Pivot Fertilisers, was announced. The demerger is subject to final Board approval, shareholder and<br>other third-party approvals. Strategic review of Waggaman plant to be undertaken in light of positive<br>outlook for global ammonia market and external interest in the plant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |  |  |  |

| Titanobel acquisition                                              | Acquired 100% of the shares in Explinvest, the holding company of the Titanobel Group – a leading<br>French industrial explosives manufacturer and drilling, blasting and technical services provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |  |  |  |
| Waggaman CO2<br>Sequestration Plans                                | A Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study is underway for a Carbon Capture Facility at Waggaman<br>capable of processing up to 950,000 metric tonnes of CO2<br>to transport via a pipeline to a permanent<br>geological sequestration site. Emissions from the plant represent 45 per cent of Dyno Nobel's<br>total greenhouse gas emissions. If it proceeds, this project alone could reduce these emissions by<br>approximately 30% against the 2020 baseline, or about 800,000 tonnes of CO2<br>e per year.                                                                                                             |  |  |  |  |
| Easy Liquids<br>acquisition                                        | Acquired the Easy Liquids (formerly Yara Nipro) business to provide increased liquid fertiliser options<br>and enhanced security of supply for farmers across the east coast of Australia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |  |  |  |
| Green ammonia<br>production a<br>step closer                       | Partnering with Fortescue Future Industries, IPL commenced a FEED study into the industrial-scale<br>production of green ammonia at our Gibson Island fertiliser manufacturing facility. The proposal under<br>investigation involves the construction of a new ~500MW hydrogen electrolysis facility at the site to<br>produce green hydrogen as well as the retrofitting of IPL's existing ammonia manufacturing facility to<br>run on the green hydrogen produced onsite.

# <span id="page-15-0"></span>**CHAIRMAN'S REPORT**

2022 has been a stand-out year for the IPL Group, marked by a record result against a backdrop of geo-political and economic challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic.

As we look towards 2023, our improved performance and strategic progress has positioned the business well to capitalise on the favourable market conditions. We have very good momentum and we remain absolutely focused on our corporate strategy.

The strategic progress of both our explosives and fertilisers businesses during the year led to our announcement in May of our intention to demerge these two different businesses during 2023. With two separate dedicated boards, leadership teams, and appropriate capital structures, these two iconic businesses will be positioned to thrive and pursue their respective strategies unencumbered.

Also, in November 2022 and consistent with our long-term strategy, we announced a strategic review of our ownership in our ammonia production plant in Waggaman, Louisiana, with the timing driven by interest from a number of credible counterparties. The strategic review of Waggaman means that the timeline for the demerger will be delayed by approximately 6-12 months.

We continue to invest significantly in a number of projects to address climate change on our journey to Net Zero by 2050. These projects are positioned to deliver our medium term absolute GHG reduction target and, have the potential to deliver a more than 42% emission reduction for IPL's current portfolio by 2030.

I am pleased to announce that we were once again included in the S&P Global Dow Jones Sustainability Index due to our Company Benchmarking Score for 2022. We improved our 2021 score, positioning ourselves well against our industry peers and improving our own score by 15 points over the past decade. These results validate the work we are doing to improve the sustainability of your company.

### **Financial performance**

We reported a 162% increase in Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) excluding individually material items (IMIs) to \$1,485m. Our Net Profit after Tax (excluding IMIs) of \$1,027m, is up 186% compared to the prior year.

Dyno Nobel Americas reported EBIT of US\$532.8m, up from US\$141.2m, with strong second half manufacturing performance capturing favourable commodity markets. However, a lag in passing through price increases to address inflation impacted explosives margins in the second half.

Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific delivered EBIT of \$162m, up 16%, reflecting strong volumes and growth from technology sales.

Fertilisers EBIT increased to \$614m, up from \$268.4m, with manufacturing more than doubling earnings during the year.

We retained a strong balance sheet with net debt of \$1bn and Net Debt/ EBITDA ratio ex IMIs of 0.5x, down from 1.1x.

With the improved earnings performance, strong cash generation and balance sheet strength, the Board was pleased to announce a record final dividend of 17 cents per share, taking our total dividend to 27 cents per share. In addition, the Board has announced an on-market share buyback of up to \$400m over the next 12 months.

We also continue to focus on improving our return on invested capital (ROIC) and in 2022 we achieved a 13.8% ROIC, up from 5.8% in the prior year.

The Board will continue to focus on ensuring we have an appropriate capital structure to support the opportunities ahead for the business, as well as delivering strong returns for shareholders.

{16}------------------------------------------------

### **Towards the demerger**

The Board believes that significant value can be unlocked by the separation of the explosives and fertilisers businesses, with both operating in large and attractive markets that value their industry leading technology and products.

With increased focus and appropriate capital structures, processes and policies for each business, these two iconic, but different businesses will be unencumbered to pursue their respective and unique destinies.

Now, more than ever, we are seeing the increasing importance of food security and mining extraction to the world, as well as the rapid acceleration towards decarbonisation and electrification.

There is unprecedented opportunity for us to accelerate our growth through the development of technology and customer solutions and to capture the significant potential in the resources and agricultural sectors.

And given how quickly the world is changing and the opportunity set in front of both businesses – it is clear that separating the two companies will further empower them to more successfully capture these markets.

The progress that Jeanne and the team have made to improve the reliability of our assets and develop and grow technology, coupled with our overall balance sheet capability, mean that we will pursue a separation from a position of strength.

This allows us to ensure both businesses will have capital structures that reflect their different earnings profiles and have the capacity to invest in the compelling growth opportunities they have in front of them.

Also, we know there is a high level of interest for an opportunity for separate exposures to either a premium explosives business, or a focused Australian fertilisers business from both existing shareholders and prospective shareholders. This reinforces our view that increased choice for investors will be an important contributor in unlocking value from the separation.

We look forward to presenting the demerger proposal in further detail over coming months and to the shareholder vote expected within the next 12 months.

### **Waggaman strategic review**

Our corporate strategy is focused on adding value through technology solutions for our customers in both of our businesses to grow recurring earnings.

The review of Waggaman is in direct alignment with our long term corporate strategy and addresses the excess commodity exposure to ammonia in our current portfolio.

Given the current performance of Waggaman, the outlook for the global ammonia market and the external interest in this asset, we believe that now is the optimum time for the review and so completing the review will result in a short delay in the demerger process.

We will, of course, look to minimise the delay so as to retain the momentum we have established with the demerger process.

### **Our people**

During the year, as travel once again became possible, the Board was able to visit our people on the ground with Board visits to Townsville, Gibson Island, Geelong and Werribee in Australia and Salt Lake City, Waggaman and Carthage in the USA. These visits provide us with important opportunities to gain more insights into the business, our people and our customers.

In the lead up to the demerger, we have made some exciting appointments for a future, stand-alone fertilisers business.

In June, we were delighted to announce Michael Carroll as Chairmandesignate of the fertilisers business. Mike is a highly experienced director and has a long history working in the agricultural sector across finance, fertilisers and agricultural services.

In addition, current IPL Board member, Greg Robinson, will join Mike on the future board as a non-executive director. Greg will be a valuable addition, bringing knowledge of the fertilisers business, along with extensive experience across the resources, energy and finance sectors.

We have also appointed the CEO-designate and CFO-designate for the fertilisers business with Christine Corbett and Chris Opperman taking on these roles and establishing what is a very capable senior management team to lead the business both in the lead up to, and following, the demerger.

I would like to sincerely thank our Managing Director & CEO Jeanne Johns and the Executive Team for their impressive leadership, and all our people for their incredible hard work and dedication to IPL throughout the year.

I would also like to thank my fellow Board members for their contribution throughout the year.

Looking ahead, your company is in a strong position as we enter FY23 with both of our businesses performing well in very attractive markets and with great opportunities to be able to continue creating value for our shareholders and all other stakeholders. We have clear strategic directions established for both businesses and will be working diligently to deliver on those strategies over the coming year.

**Brian Kruger** Chairman

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>**MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO'S REPORT**

It is my pleasure to report a company record performance for the 2022 financial year along with the significant strategic progress made during the year.

This performance is the result of a resilient and adaptive team working to offset the impacts of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, shortages of key materials and skilled people, and inflationary pressure. I thank our people across the business for both their extraordinary efforts and the terrific outcome under these challenging circumstances.

I am particularly proud of our cross functional team including those at Gibson Island who responded to the Australian government's concerns about AdBlue supply shortage over year-end 2021/22. IPL worked closely with the Australian government to increase our production from our normal 10% market share up to, at times, 80%. It was an extraordinary team effort over a normally peak vacation period and I want to acknowledge all the sacrifices made by our people to keep Australian trucks and other essential vehicles moving.

Our company prospered throughout the 2022 financial year and is well positioned going into next year. Our customers value our reliability of supply and our distinctive technology that supports their safety, environmental, and productivity goals. We produce essential products which underpin the agricultural and resource industries. Our business and supply chain teams have worked tirelessly to keep our customers supplied and our business performing at a high level.

### **Safety and sustainability**

Our Zero Harm value has served us well during the peak of COVID-19 in January of this year. I am proud of how the team responded to the COVID-19 crisis – showing care for each other and our customers, putting in place the processes and systems to keep people safe. Our COVID-19 response has now been integrated into our overall safety management system.

Our safety journey continued to improve as the number of process safety incidents decreased by 34%. While our personal safety recordable rate stayed flat, I was pleased that injuries that resulted in serious harm continued to decrease for the third year running.

We continue on our journey to Net Zero by 2050, or earlier if practicable. In 2022, we progressed four significant projects to achieve this – Moranbah tertiary nitrous oxide abatement, Waggaman geological sequestration, the conversion of our Gibson Island manufacturing facility to green ammonia, and nitrous oxide abatement for our Louisiana, Missouri, facility. I am pleased that these four projects aim to deliver in excess of 42% GHG emission reductions against our 2020 baseline, for our current portfolio. We will be re-visiting our medium-term target next year as these projects progress and following the release of the Science Based Targets Initiative target setting methodology for the chemicals sector.

(1) Results from a field trial conducted in a ryegrass pasture system in south–western Victoria show the application of EEF with the inhibitor DMPP reduced N2 O emissions by 73% when compared to urea application alone. See the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment Climate Research Program: Reducing Nitrous Oxide Emissions, p.5

We also made significant progress in identifying and measuring the Scope 3 GHG emissions in our supply chains. In collaboration with a customer, we measured GHG emission reductions of 25% with the use of our premium technology DeltaE, which is currently being verified by an independent third party. Our enhanced efficiency fertilisers have also demonstrated an ability to reduce emissions from their use by up to 70% (1) dependent upon the application, for our farming customers.

{18}------------------------------------------------

### **Business performance**

2022 represents the best financial performance in IPL corporate history with \$1,027m NPAT excluding IMIs.

Our Waggaman plant delivered US\$344m in FY22 after US\$70m in insurance recovery related to the February outage caused by a thirdparty original construction issue. I am very pleased to report that the plant continues to run reliably above the 95% manufacturing excellence target since its restart in April.

Our explosive businesses operate in two of the best mining regions in the world, Australia and North America.

In North America, our explosives EBIT of US\$110m was down 13% due to the lag in recovering energy, inflation, and supply chain cost increases. Overall volumes grew with good sales growth of our premium technology of electronic detonators and further Delta E uptake. The volume growth was driven by strong performance in Quarry and Construction and an increase in coal demand. Metals were slightly down due to temporary customer mine outages, partially offset by growth in the Western US and Eastern Canada. Our manufacturing Agriculture and Industrial Chemicals segment delivered a record US\$79m due to strong operations at St. Helens facility post the 2021 turnaround, capturing the available margin.

In our Asia Pacific region, EBIT increased 16% to \$162m reflecting strong customer and technology growth with a 14% increase in premium emulsions and an 18% increase in electronic detonators.

Ammonium nitrate supply continues to be tight in both of our explosives markets and our businesses are well situated to capture projected positive pricing upon contract renewals over the next few years.

Our fertilisers business delivered an EBIT of \$614m, up 129%, as the business captured the upswing in commodity pricing while delivering a major planned turnaround at Phosphate Hill. The disruption in contracted natural gas supply from the Northern Territory to Phosphate Hill was managed to ensure the plant continued throughout the period at full rates. Natural gas will be secured for the coming year until full contracted supply is expected to resume in February. Distribution earnings remained resilient in a volatile supply and pricing environment, supported by good demand and agricultural conditions.

### **Progressing our strategic agenda**

We made excellent progress across our strategic agenda for both businesses during the year.

We completed our purchase of Titanobel, entering the French quarry and construction market and providing access to Western African markets, with future facing mineral opportunities. The low penetration of technology in key European and African markets, especially electronic detonators, is a large opportunity for this business. When combined with our existing Nitromak business in Turkey, we have a compelling foundation to grow our explosives business across the EMEA region.

Our soil health strategy was furthered with the purchase of Yara Nipro (now renamed Easy Liquids) and the increased ownership in Australian BioFerts. With these purchases, we will extend our fertiliser offering to more organic bio fertilisers and expand our offer in liquid specialty products, which are both growing segments of the fertilisers market.

Along with our pathway to Net Zero for each of our businesses, these purchases set the foundation for our intention to demerge and create two sector leading companies to pursue their different destinies.

### **Leadership**

We are pleased to have CEO-designate of our fertiliser business, Christine Corbett, join the business. Christine joins the company with a wealth of executive experience in energy, e-commerce, retail and logistics, and will join the Executive Team running the fertilisers business until the demerger takes place.

Further strengthening our Executive Team, I am very pleased to welcome Paul Victor as our CFO. Paul brings strong financial and business experience from his previous CFO role with the publicly listed entity Sasol of South Africa.

We are proud of our culture of valuing people and their development which has led to the opportunity to promote some of our key talent. Upon embedding the manufacturing facilities inside our business units, I was pleased to appoint Stephenie DeNichilio as our Chief HSE and Operations Excellence Officer during the year. Rob Mill likewise joined the Executive Team as Chief People Officer.

I want to offer my thanks to the dedicated teams across our businesses for their contributions to the company's success. I would also like to extend my thanks to the Board for their invaluable support during the year.

### **Looking forward**

The supply/demand fundamentals for our products continue to look very favourable as we enter the new year. Our priority is to capture these tailwinds while managing supply disruptions and inflationary pressure. We remain focused on safe, reliable operations, serving our customers with leading technology solutions, and enhancing our supply chain resilience.

We continue to invest in both our businesses in line with the macro trends of decarbonising the world's energy while meeting growing demand for food and materials. With investment in our strategy, we are targeting in the medium term for mid-to-high single digit growth in our explosives business and doubling our fertiliser distribution earnings through soil health offerings and improved supply positions.

Our focus entering the new year is to maintain our momentum in earnings while we pursue the strategic option review for Waggaman. Demerger preparations will continue as we look to unlock additional value from these two iconic companies so they can pursue their respective destinies.

### **Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) excluding Individually Material Items (ex IMIs)**

IPL reported NPAT (excl. IMIs) of \$1,027m, an increase of 186% compared to \$359m in the pcp.

### **Individually Material Items (IMIs)**

NPAT for FY22 includes a loss of \$13m (FY21 a loss of \$209m) of aftertax IMIs relating to costs incurred in preparing for IPL's proposed demerger (\$9.2m pre-tax) and additional costs associated with the preparations for the closure of IPL's gas manufacturing facilities at Gibson Island, Queensland, (\$10m pre-tax).

### **Capital Management**

Earnings per share (EPS) ex IMIs of 52.9 cents per share increased by 34.4 cents per share compared to FY21 EPS of 18.5 cents.

A final dividend of 17 cents per share 100% franked has been announced, representing a 51% payout ratio of NPAT (excl. IMIs).

In addition to the final dividend, IPL announced its intention to undertake an on-market share buyback of \$400 million over a 12 month period. This announcement is in line with the Capital Allocation Framework announced at IPL's Investor Day on 6 September 2022. IPL has established its Capital Allocation Framework with the objective of enhancing shareholder value through optimising its weighted average cost of capital while retaining an appropriately strong credit profile in support of its investment grade credit ratings.

The buyback is expected to benefit shareholders by reducing the shares on issue with a resultant improvement in earnings per share, dividends per share and returns on equity.

IPL has sufficient cash reserves and committed bank facilities to complete the buyback. The share buyback will be conducted in the ordinary course of trading and the exact amount and timing of share purchases will be dependent on regulatory requirements and market conditions.

### **Net Debt**

Net debt increased by \$32m to \$1,036m at 30 September 2022 (pcp: \$1,004m) and Net Debt/EBITDA ex IMIs decreased to 0.5x (pcp: 1.1x). Net debt increased during the year as a result of the acquisitions of Titanobel and Yara Nipro (\$144m), investments in sustenance (including turnarounds) and minor growth projects (\$434m), dividends paid to shareholders (\$355m), lease liability payments (\$43m) and other non-cash movements in net debt (\$139m) offsetting almost \$1.1b of operating cashflows. The Group's investment grade credit ratings were maintained:

- » S&P: BBB (stable outlook)
- » Moody's: Baa2 (stable outlook)

### **Zero Harm**

IPL's Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (5) (TRIFR) for the rolling twelve-month period ended 30 September 2022 was 0.89, an increase from 0.87 at 30 September 2021. There were 25 Process Safety Incidents (6) recorded in FY22 (pcp:38). The Company maintained its strong environmental safety record with zero Significant Environmental Incidents (7) during the year (pcp: 0). IPL has refreshed its safety programs to drive improvement.

### **FY22 Business Review**

The Group reported FY22 Earnings Before Interest and Tax excluding IMI's (EBIT) of \$1,485m, an increase of \$919m compared to pcp. Major movements for the year were as follows:

**Manufacturing Performance:** Aside from the one-off incident at WALA, the plant operated at nameplate capacity throughout the year. With the exception of Phosphate Hill where production rates were below nameplate leading into the turnaround, manufacturing reliability saw strong improvements at IPL's other ammonia plants. This is a positive reflection of the investment made by IPL into improving plant reliability over the past 4 years.

The net financial impact of planned turnarounds was negligible with the favourable impact of turnarounds in FY21 at Waggaman, Moranbah and St Helens offset by the impact of the Phosphate Hill turnaround in FY22. The Cheyenne turnaround, scheduled for later in FY23, is the last of the plants scheduled for its turnaround as part of the reliability improvement plan.

Reliable production at around nameplate capacity has been achieved at all plants following the turnarounds.

**Phosphate Hill Gas:** Phosphate Hill's contracted gas supply was disrupted throughout the year due to the performance of a third party provider. To maintain production and capitalise on a high DAP price, gas was purchased on the spot market at an incremental cost to contract of \$41m. IPF's gas supplier has advised that full quantities are expected to be restored by February 2023.

**Depreciation:** The \$7m net favourable depreciation impact is largely driven by the impairment of the Gibson Island manufacturing facility (recognised in September 2021) resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of \$23m in the fertilisers business. This was partially offset by additional charges resulting from the three major turnarounds completed in FY21 (Waggaman, St Helens and Moranbah).

**WALA Incident:** An incident occurred in mid-February 2022 (net \$83m) which brought the plant down for repairs for approximately 8 weeks at a cost of \$182m (US\$128m). The insurance claim was finalised during the year and resulted in a recovery of approximately \$99m (US\$70m).

**Americas Explosives:** The \$11m improvement was supported by strong market growth primarily across the Coal and Q&C sectors. End market coal production has been supported by elevated natural gas prices, while construction rates remain strong despite escalating inflation. Further to this, the business results were negatively impacted by a lagging impact of passing on the continuous price increases experienced during the year.

**Asia Pacific Explosives:** Dyno Nobel's premium technology suite continues to deliver strong results underpinning the \$32m improvement in earnings. Increased sales of key offerings such as Delta E, Cyber Det and Electronics contributed an additional \$8m in earnings compared with the pcp, with a further \$7m benefit coming from new customers looking to gain access to Dyno's advanced technology. As previously communicated to the market, a further \$11m earnings improvement came from the less profitable WA contracts rolling off in FY22. The international businesses continue to recover from the impacts of COVID with an increase in offshore earnings (primarily Turkey) of approximately \$10m. Unfavourable weather conditions negatively impacted the result by \$4m.

**Asia Pacific Fertilisers:** The \$9m decrease in distribution earnings primarily relates to a reduction in domestic sales volume and costs associated with investment in the distribution network. Heavy rains in key regions in Southern Queensland and NSW impacted fertiliser application, while high prices also resulted in reduced demand. The extreme price volatility during the year was managed through selective procurement and stock management decisions – resulting in year on year volume reduction. However, strong margins (on a dollar per tonne basis) were realised.

**Supply Chain/Inflation:** Despite management action to address cost pressures through efficiency improvements and contract pricing, the speed and extent of global supply chain pressures and rising inflation had a negative impact on the FY22 result. The impact was most prominent in the DNA business (\$41m of the \$54m) and includes higher cost of energy, raw materials related to Initiating Systems and abnormal freight costs driven by supply chain disruptions. The lag in recovery of these cost increases is expected to materially reduce in FY23.

**Commodity Prices & Foreign Exchange:** Higher commodity prices, primarily ammonia and DAP, contributed \$920m to the result compared to pcp, with a weaker Australian dollar contributing a further benefit of \$80m.

**Corporate:** Corporate costs increased compared to the pcp. The increase includes provisioning for legal claims.

### **Strategic review of WALA and implications for structural separation of the Explosives and Fertilisers businesses**

On 15 November 2022, IPL announced that it had received a number of unsolicited approaches in relation to a potential acquisition of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA). The Company will undertake a review of the strategic options for WALA in the near-term. Under any scenario, IPL intends to maintain the strategic value of long-term supply of ammonia from WALA into the Dyno Nobel Americas business. An estimate of the financial impact cannot be made at this point.

The strategic review process will have implications for the timing of the proposed structural separation of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses which was announced on 23 May 2022. It is currently anticipated that the previously communicated target completion date for the separation of early 2023 will likely be extended by 6-12 months, pending the completion of the strategic review process for WALA. There has been no impact on the financial statements for FY22 in relation to the proposed structural separation other than the costs incurred to date which have been classified as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Major movements in the Group's Balance Sheet during the year include:

### **Assets**

- » **Trade Working Capital (TWC)**: Net increase of \$495m. The movement was mainly due to the impact of higher commodities in both the Fertilisers and Explosives businesses (\$292m) and the lower utilisation of trade working capital financing facilities (\$64m). Change in accounting method to transfer precious metals to inventory (\$48m) and business acquisitions/new business (\$91m). Underlying trade working capital (excluding the impact of financing facilities) as a percentage of sales remained flat with the pcp at 16.2%.
- » **Net Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)**: Increase of \$318m (\$140m excl impact of FX translation). Mainly driven by sustenance and turnaround capital expenditure of \$316m, growth and sustainability capital spend of \$119m and the fixed assets acquired through the purchase of Titanobel and Yara Nipro (\$32m). This is partially offset by depreciation expense for the year of \$303m, disposals and writedowns of \$11m and transfers to inventory of \$12m.
- » **Intangible Assets**: Increase of \$281m (\$90m excluding the impact of FX translation). Mainly driven by the goodwill and other intangibles recognised upon acquisition of Titanobel and Yara Nipro of \$92m. Amortisation charges for the year are mostly offset by minor additions.

### **Liabilities**

- » **Environmental & restructure liabilities**: Increase of \$6m (\$1m excluding the impact of FX translation). Mainly driven by an increase in the Gibson Island closure provision of \$10m and the interest unwind on long term asset restoration obligation provisions of \$5m. This was offset by spend against provisions for the year, primarily in relation to Gibson Island closure preparation.
- » **Net other assets**: Increase of \$137m. Mainly due to Phosphate Hill security deposit paid in relation to spot gas purchases of \$46m, WALA insurance proceeds accrual \$35m (of which approximately \$25m has since been received) and settlement of the payable owing to the bank as part of the trade receivables facility at 30 September 2021 of \$58m.
- » **Net Debt**: Increase of \$32m (decrease of \$77m excluding the impact of FX translation). Mainly due to strong cash generation driven by rising commodity prices offset by a reduction in the use of trade working capital financing facilities (-\$64m), payments related to sustenance capital expenditure (-\$343m), growth capital (-\$91m) and payment for acquisitions of Titanobel and Yara Nipro (-\$144m). Further details of movements in Net Debt are provided in the Cashflow section of this report.

The fair value of Net debt hedges at 30 September 2022 was a liability of \$88m, a decrease of \$101m compared to an asset balance at 30 September 2021 of \$13m. The decrease was mainly due to interest rate movements on derivatives hedging the Group's fixed rate bonds.

Financial indebtedness reduced by \$29m through the year. Net debt increased by \$32m with strong operating cashflows (\$1,157m – excluding \$64m of trade working capital facilities reduction) offset by sustenance capital expenditure (\$343m), growth capital expenditure (\$91m), payments for acquisitions (net of debt acquired) (\$174m), dividends to shareholders (\$355m) and FX on translation of foreign denominated debt (\$115m). Reliance on trade working capital financing facilities has been reduced by \$144m since September 2020 to \$268m at year end.

<sup>(1)</sup> Average TWC as % of revenue = 13-month average trade working capital/12 months rolling revenue.

<sup>(2)</sup> Net debt comprises the net of interest-bearing liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, and the fair value of derivative instruments economically hedging the Group's interest-bearing liabilities. (3) Net debt (adjusted for average exchange rate for the year)/EBITDA incl TWC facilities ratio is calculated using 12 month rolling EBITDA ex IMIs. Net debt for this ratio has been adjusted to include the usage of factoring and reverse factoring facilities.

<sup>(4)</sup> Net debt (adjusted for average exchange rate for the year)/EBITDA ratio is calculated using 12 month rolling EBITDA ex IMIs.

<sup>(5)</sup> Interest Cover = 12 month rolling EBITDA ex IMIs/net interest expense before accounting adjustments.

{23}------------------------------------------------

### **Credit Metrics**

**Net Debt/EBITDA:** The ratio of 0.5x improved by 0.6x compared with the pcp. The improvement is primarily a result of higher earnings in FY22 with EBITDA (excl. IMIs) improving 99% over the pcp.

**Interest Cover**: Improved to 20.3x (pcp: 9.7x).

**Credit Ratings:** Investment Grade credit ratings remained unchanged:

- » S&P: BBB (stable outlook)
- » Moody's: Baa2 (stable outlook)

### **Debt Facilities**

IPL has sufficient liquidity and headroom with \$797m of available undrawn committed debt facilities at 30 September 2022.

The average tenor of the Group's debt facilities at 30 September 2022 is 4.2 years (September 2021: 5.1 years). No committed debt facilities are due to mature until April 2024.

### **Trade Working Capital Facilities**

IPL uses trade working capital facilities to effectively manage the Group's cash flows, which are impacted by seasonality, demand and supply variability.

The Group has a non-recourse receivable purchasing agreement to sell certain domestic and international receivables to an unrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2022, receivables totalling \$95m (30 September 2021: \$124m) had been sold under the receivable purchasing agreement.

IPL also offers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing. The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against several indicators to assess whether to classify outstanding amounts as payables or borrowings. The balance of the supply chain finance program, classified as payables, at 30 September 2022 was \$173m (30 September 2020: \$208m).

### **Capital Allocation**

IPL's capital allocation process is centralised and overseen by the Group's Corporate Finance function. Capital is invested on a prioritised basis and all submissions are assessed against risk factors including HSE, sustainability, operational, financial and other strategic risks. Capital is broadly categorised into first order capital (sustenance, turnaround, sustainability and minor growth) and second order capital (major growth).

Other than the company acquisitions during the year, there was no second order capital investment.

The table below includes a summary of cash spend per business on growth and sustenance capital:

| Total                | 434.0 | 355.0                   | 79.0   |  |

Subject to currency fluctuations, sustenance spend is expected to be in the range of \$180m to \$220m. Turnaround spend is expected to be approximately \$60m to \$80m with spending on sustainability targeted to be between \$50m and \$60m. These amounts don't include one-off strategic sustenance expenditure on upgrades of Gibson Island distribution assets in order to return volumes to historical market share levels.

### **Operating Cash Flow**

Operating cash flows of \$1,093m increased by \$443m compared to the pcp. Significant movements included:

- » **EBITDA**: Increased by \$923m driven by favourable realised commodity price movements (\$920m) and favourable movements in the A\$:US\$ exchange rate (\$80m). The unfavourable one-off net impact of the WALA incident in mid-February of \$83m and the Phosphate Hill gas supply disruption of \$41m was partially offset by improved manufacturing reliability, particularly at Waggaman of \$75m. Downstream business earnings (excluding manufacturing, non-controllables and supply chain/inflation impacts) improved by \$34m primarily due to growth in the DNAP business. The impact of supply chain disruptions and inflation was \$54m.
- » **Net Interest Paid**: Decreased by \$25m, principally as a result of a one-off interest cost in FY21 relating to the bond buy-back (\$14m) and lower levels of borrowings in FY22 versus pcp, partially offset by increasing interest rates and a weakening AUD.
- » **TWC Movement**: Increased \$272m compared to the pcp largely as a result of higher commodities driving higher TWC balances at the end of FY22 and lower usage of trade working capital financing facilities (down \$64m on pcp).
- » **Dividends received from JV's**: Decreased by \$37m with one of IPL's larger JV partners (QNP) not paying a dividend in FY22 due to a turnaround taking place during the year. Turnarounds generally take place every 4 years. Additionally, a large US based joint venture declared a lower dividend in FY22 compared with FY21.
- » **Other Non-TWC**: Decreased \$115m compared to the pcp largely as a result of timing of payments and accruals including the Phosphate Hill security deposit paid in relation to spot gas purchases of \$46m and WALA insurance proceeds accrual of \$35m.

### **Investing Cash Flow**

Net investing cash outflows of \$575m increased \$232m as compared to the pcp. Significant movements included:

- » Minor growth capital: Higher growth spend of \$40m supporting plant efficiency projects and other projects supporting volume growth and technology investments. These projects have a short pay-back period.
- » Sustenance capital: Higher sustenance spend reflects the impact of the largest turnaround on record at Phosphate Hill/ Mt Isa (\$87m in FY22), decarbonisation projects required to meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets and investment in manufacturing and distribution facilities to drive reliability improvement.
- » Acquisition of subsidiaries and non-controlling interests: Cash outflow for the acquisition of Titanobel (\$124m) and Yara Nipro (\$20m).

### **Financing Cash Flow**

Net financing cash outflow of \$551m was \$267m higher compared with the pcp. Significant movements included:

- » Dividends paid to members of IPL: Higher dividend of \$336m in line with increased earnings. Payout ratio of 51% of Group NPAT (excl IMI's).
- » Foreign Exchange on Net Debt: The non-cash increase of \$107m reflects the impact from translating US dollar denominated debt at a lower exchange rate.

Average realised A\$/US\$ exchange rate 0.70 0.74 Urea (FOB NOLA) Index Price (US\$/mt) 713 364 Dyno Nobel Americas FY22 earnings of US\$533m increased

US\$392m, or 277%, compared to the pcp. Outlined below are the major earnings movements during the year for each business segment.

### **Explosives**

#### **Business Performance**

Explosives earnings for FY22 of US\$110m was US\$16m lower than the pcp principally due to the following:

**EBIT Margins:** The rapid impact of inflation, energy costs and supply chain interruptions has had a temporary negative impact on EBIT margins.

**Manufacturing:** The positive earnings impact of US\$5m reflects the recovery from outages in FY21 at the Cheyenne, WY. and Louisiana, MO, plants. The recovery was partially offset by the impact of minor outages at the Louisiana, MO, plant in 2H22.

**Customer Growth:** US\$8m growth in volumes, primarily driven by Quarries & Construction, where volumes were up 9% on pcp due to strong market fundamentals and market share gain. The elevated natural gas prices also led to a resurgence in end market coal demand (volumes up 19%), driving elevated volumes vs pcp.

While Metals volumes were down overall (-4%) due to customer mine closures, 2H22 volumes were supported by the start-up of several new customers.

**Supply Chain / Inflation:** Inflationary pressure, higher energy costs, and supply chain dislocation led to a US\$29m unfavourable impact to earnings:

- » **Inflationary Pressure:** US\$9m unfavourable impact due to high demand for raw materials and tightness in supply driving up material costs at a quicker rate than price recovery.
- » **Higher Energy cost:** US\$12m increase due to elevated utility and commodity prices. Elevated ammonia and fuel costs, together with higher electricity charges, impacted the cost of production and supply.
- » **Supply Chain Dislocation:** US\$8m increase in costs related to scarcity of raw materials, which results in additional freight movements to supply customers and plants, and led to elevated costs to meet customer demand. The rate of inflation increases was unprecedented. Management has worked to reduce the lag caused by continuous cost increases.

#### **Market Summary**

### Quarry & Construction

42% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Quarry & Construction sector in FY22 (43% pcp). The strong growth in this sector in 1H22 carried over into 2H22 as US infrastructure spending and a healthy construction market supported 9% volume growth compared to pcp.

#### Base & Precious Metals

36% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Base & Precious Metals sector in FY22 (39% pcp). Volumes decreased by 4% during the year with revenues (in dollar terms) near flat compared to the pcp. The primary driver of the decreased volume was temporary customer mine closures and lower seasonal Arctic shipments which are expected to return to previous levels in 2H23. These volume decreases were partially offset by volume growth in the Western US.

#### Coal

22% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Coal sector in FY22 (18% pcp). Volumes were up 19% versus the pcp as elevated natural gas prices have incentivised the power sector to temporarily switch back to more coal-generated power.

{26}------------------------------------------------

### **Agriculture & Industrial Chemicals (Ag & IC)**

#### **Business Performance**

Ag & IC FY22 earnings of US\$79m was US\$68m more than the pcp, primarily due to the following:

**Manufacturing/Turnaround:** Earnings recovered US\$8m from FY21 impacts of the planned outage at the St. Helens, OR plant (US\$5.3m), along with strong manufacturing performance post turnaround (US\$4.2m) offset in part by higher depreciation costs of US\$1.5m.

**Commodity Prices:** Favourable Urea and UAN pricing improved earnings by US\$60m versus the pcp.

#### **Business Performance**

Waggaman earnings of US\$344m, increased US\$340m compared to the pcp due to the following:

**Commodity Prices:** The strong upswing in global ammonia prices driven by the impact of high European gas prices on ammonia supply resulted in higher domestic ammonia prices. Elevated natural gas prices partially offset this favourable movement resulting in a net favourable earnings impact of US\$303m.

**Manufacturing Reliability:** Production at the Waggaman plant was at nameplate capacity preceding, and at nameplate after, the reported 1H22 incident. The recovery from the turnaround and weather outages in the pcp resulted in a US\$103m benefit.

**1H22 outage:** As previously disclosed, the FY22 results were impacted by an 8-week closure of the facility, which resulted in a US\$128m negative impact to the result. IPL recovered approximately US\$70m from property insurance coverage, resulting in a net impact from the outage of US\$58m.

**Depreciation:** US\$8m higher than pcp. As previously disclosed, depreciation is higher primarily as a result of the FY21 turnaround. **Discount to Tampa Ammonia price:** The discount realised on sales priced at Tampa benchmark in FY22 was approximately 8% prior to the 8-week outage. The timing of sales volumes contributes to the disconnect between the realised price and the benchmark index, as the outage coincided with highest benchmark months.

The discount realised on sales priced on other benchmarks (primarily sales to Dyno's Louisiana MO facility) performed as expected in the elevated Tampa Ammonia pricing market, with FY22 being the first year since operations commenced where the pricing resulted in a discount to Tampa rather than a premium. Ammonia supply (into Dyno's Louisiana, MO facility) and offtake (from Waggaman, LA facility) decisions are continuously evaluated to maximise cash flow to the Dyno Nobel Americas business.

#### **Manufacturing**

Manufacturing performance in the Explosives and Ag & IC businesses during FY22 was as follows:

**Cheyenne, Wyoming:** Cheyenne ammonia operations recovered from unplanned outages in FY21. As a result, ammonia production was up 3% compared to pcp. Nitric Acid production was negatively impacted due to an unplanned electrical feed outage, resulting in decreased production of 2% compared to pcp.

**Louisiana, Missouri:** Overall production was up 16% on the pcp.

**St Helens, Oregon:** Urea and ammonia production from the St Helens plant increased 25% and 28% respectively, compared to the pcp, with plant production slightly above expectations post turnaround.

**Waggaman, Louisiana:** As previously disclosed, the plant operated at nameplate capacity up to the February incident that resulted in an 8-week closure of the facility. Following a successful re-start in mid-April 2022, the plant operated at nameplate capacity for the remainder of FY22.

**W.A. Contracts:** \$11m increase, in line with previous guidance.

**Growth Customer:** \$7m growth on the pcp, mostly driven by new hard rock and underground business.

**Growth Technology:** \$8m growth on the pcp, largely in line with guidance provided in FY20, driven by strong electronics and Differential Energy volumes.

**International:** \$10m increase, mostly driven by business recovery in Turkey.

**Weather:** \$4m decrease on the pcp driven by wet weather mainly impacting Australian Coal.

**Manufacturing Reliability:** \$8m increase on the pcp driven by increased reliability of the Moranbah Plant post the FY21 turnaround.

**Depreciation:** \$5m negative impact mostly driven by the FY21 Moranbah turnaround capital expenditure.

**Supply Chain/Inflation:** \$13m impact mostly driven by higher cost Urea and general inflation across the fixed cost base of the business.

#### **Market Summary**

#### Australian Coal

41% of Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific revenue for the year was generated from the Australian Coal sector, most of which was from supply to the metallurgical coal mines in the Bowen Basin.

Volumes from the Australian Coal sector increased 6% compared to pcp mainly due to stronger Trade volumes.

#### Base & Precious Metals

41% of Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific revenue was generated from the Base & Precious Metals sector, which comprises iron ore mines in Western Australia and hard rock and underground mines throughout Australia.

Volumes from the sector remained relatively flat compared to pcp with stronger hard rock and underground business volumes offset by slightly lower iron ore volumes.

#### International

18% of Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific revenue was generated internationally in Indonesia, Turkey, Papua New Guinea and France.

Volumes increased by 26% compared to the pcp, mainly driven by the acquisition of the Titanobel business, and stronger volumes in the Indonesia business.

#### Titanobel

In May 2022 the Group acquired 100% of Titanobel, a business which is highly complementary to Dyno Nobel's existing operations and provides access to new markets where Dyno Nobel can leverage its premium technology offering. Titanobel is a leading industrial explosives manufacturer and drilling, blasting and technical services provider based in France.

#### Manufacturing

Moranbah performed well producing 371k mt of ammonium nitrate during the year and achieving Ammonia Plant reliability of 95% post the FY21 Turnaround.

** Weighted average of AP including port costs

#### **Business Performance**

Fertilisers Asia Pacific earnings of \$614m was 129% higher than the pcp. Major movements for the year were due to the following:

Margin

**Foreign Exchange and Commodity Prices:** \$472m net increase, primarily driven by higher DAP price (\$851/t vs \$524/t), higher Urea price (\$710/t vs \$373/t) and lower AUD:USD exchange rate (0.72 vs 0.76), partially offset by higher cost sulphur/sulphuric acid.

**Cost of Gas – Phosphate Hill:** Gas supply disruptions at Phosphate Hill increasing FY22 gas cost by \$41m (~A\$10m incurred in 1H22). Power and Water Corporation (gas supplier) expect full supply to be restored in February 2023. Additional top-up gas volumes to be purchased to make up shortfalls to February 2023 at an estimated cost of approximately \$60m to \$70m in FY23.

**Depreciation:** Net \$23m reduction in depreciation charges due to the impairment of Gibson Island assets in September 2021 offset in part by higher depreciation at Phosphate Hill mainly related to capital expenditure for the construction of critical infrastructure.

**Planned Plant Shutdowns:** Phosphate Hill turnaround completed during 2H FY22. This planned shutdown negatively impacted earnings by \$74m compared to the pcp.

**Manufacturing Reliability:** \$25m net decrease due to lower than expected production and plant efficiency at Phosphate Hill in the run up to the turnaround.

**Volumes and Margins:** Distribution volumes were lower as a result of lower demand, largely due to higher pricing, wet weather and global fertiliser supply constraints. Distribution margins when measured as a function of revenue will naturally decrease when commodity prices increase. Distribution EBIT margin per tonne in FY22 was up slightly versus pcp.

#### **Market Summary**

Total Fertilisers Asia Pacific sales volumes of 2,576k metric tonnes was 20% lower than FY21 sales of 3,220k metric tonnes. The planned 8 week turnaround at Phosphate Hill adversely impacted sales volumes in FY23 as did lower demand, largely due to higher pricing, wet weather and global fertilisers supply constraints.

Global fertiliser prices traded significantly higher in FY22 with realised Ammonium Phosphate prices improving by more than 62% compared with the pcp while, despite its volatility, realised Urea prices increased 90% over the pcp. The supply and demand dynamic remains broadly favourable to support strong prices in the near term.

Progress on the soil health strategy continues, highlighted by an increase in Nutrient Advantage earnings and the acquisition of the Yara Nipro liquid fertiliser business.

{29}------------------------------------------------

### **Manufacturing**

Manufacturing performance in the Fertilisers Asia Pacific business in FY22 was as follows:

### **Phosphate Hill**

Ammonium phosphate production decreased to 736k mt, down 23% on pcp. The lower production was a combination of the planned turnaround as well as some critical pieces of equipment operating at below capacity leading into the turnaround that commenced in early May 2022.

Ammonium phosphates cost per tonne was impacted by a number of factors, the most consequential being the increased cost of gas and sulphur. Higher depreciation and some additional repair costs leading into the turnaround also contributed to the higher cost per tonne.

### **Gibson Island**

In response to the critical shortage of AdBlue in the Australian market resulting from international supply chain disruptions, IPL's Gibson Island plant, with the assistance of the Federal Government, was able to rapidly reconfigure its production to uprate the production of AdBlue and satisfy the Australian demand.

The plant produced 405k mt of urea equivalent product, down 19% on pcp. The majority of the reduced production resulted from various minor equipment failures and inefficiencies, the majority of which have been addressed. The plant is on track to close at the end of the calendar year.

### **OUTLOOK AND SENSITIVITIES**

IPL does not generally provide profit guidance, primarily due to the variability of commodity prices and foreign exchange movements. Instead, IPL provides an outlook for business performance expectations and sensitivities to key earnings drivers based on management's current view at the time of this report.

### **Outlook**

#### Dyno Nobel Americas

- » The explosives business is well placed to benefit from heightened ammonium nitrate pricing.
- » Apart from a potential outage of up to 4 weeks to allow the installation of a replacement cooler (if required) the Waggaman plant is expected to produce at nameplate capacity in FY23. The operational earnings of Waggaman remain subject to movements in ammonia and natural gas prices.
- » Tampa Discount Ammonia sales from the Waggaman facility should return to the historical contract mix, with tonnes that are priced off the Tampa index returning to a 6-8% discount to Tampa. Should the Tampa benchmark price remain at the recent level of circa US1,000/mt, when factoring in those sales that are not linked to the Tampa benchmark, the overall discount is expected to be between 13% and 15% in FY23.
- » Agriculture & Industrial Chemicals earnings remain subject to movements in global fertiliser prices, particularly Urea.
- » The St. Helens fertiliser plant is scheduled for a 28 day outage in February 2023 for mid-cycle maintenance.
- » The Cheyenne, WY ammonia facility is scheduled for a 55 day planned turnaround in June/July 2023.
- » Coal demand is expected to be flat to FY22 as higher demand based on elevated natural gas prices and low electric generator inventory levels lead to restocking.
- » Quarry and Construction growth is expected to continue driven by residential and infrastructure spending. Growth of 3% to 5% is expected.
- » Metals Growth in the overall metals sector is expected to be in the low single digits.
- » Dyno's market leading technology is expected to support growth in future facing commodity markets, with a recent contract win in Chile a good example.
- » The negative impacts of higher inflation, energy costs and supply chain dislocations are expected to be mostly recovered in FY23 through price escalations and contract negotiations.
- » The full year earnings from WALA that are attributable to the DNA business in FY23 could be impacted by the outcome of the announced strategic review, and the timing of the settlement of any sale transaction that may result.

#### Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific

- » Favourable pricing conditions on the East Coast of Australia are expected over the re-contracting cycle.
- » Technology growth is expected to continue at a run-rate similar to the guidance provided in FY20 as customers look to drill more complex ore bodies and increasingly value productivity, safety and environmental improvements.
- » Moranbah is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately \$10m due to the cessation of ammonia supply from Gibson Island (20kt per annum).
- » Supply Chain and inflationary costs continue to challenge and impact the business. Although efficiency improvements are expected to mitigate the impact, FY23 is expected to see a lag in being able to recover some of these costs through re-pricing.

# **OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW**

#### Fertilisers Asia Pacific

- » Fertiliser's earnings will continue to be dependent on global fertiliser prices, the A\$:US\$ exchange rate and weather conditions.
- » Despite the severe flooding in NSW and southern Queensland, agricultural conditions across Eastern Australia are generally favourable. Increased soil moisture levels in most districts on the East Coast, coupled with high dam levels is expected to drive demand for fertiliser through the year. This is further subject to weather conditions in FY23.
- » Farm economics are expected to remain favourable through FY23 with farmer cashflows supportive of strong fertiliser demand, although high fertiliser prices can influence volumes.
- » Distribution earnings expected to benefit further from IPL's soil health strategy.
- » Distribution margins and volumes will continue to be influenced by Australian East Coast agronomic conditions and global fertiliser prices. Global supply constraints ex China and Europe may pose a risk for fertiliser import volumes in FY23.
- » Phosphate Hill is expected to produce approximately 1,000kt in FY23 after a successful turnaround in FY22. Gas supply disruptions at Phosphate Hill are expected to continue in 1H FY23. Power and Water Corporation (gas supplier) confirmed full quantities to be restored in February 2023. Additional gas volumes to be purchased to make up shortfalls at an estimated incremental cost of approximately \$60m to \$70m.
- » Production of Ammonia at Gibson Island will cease in early January 2023 with a staged shutdown of downstream production anticipated to cease by end February 2023.

#### Group

**Corporate:** Corporate costs are expected to be approximately \$40m in FY23 (excluding impact of demerger). This includes an allowance for increased spend on international business development, an allowance for wage growth and minor investment in energy transition and HR Organisational Development.

**Borrowing Costs:** Net borrowing costs for FY23 are expected to be approximately \$133m. The increase is primarily related to higher interest rates and amortisation charges.

**Taxation:** IPL's effective tax rate for FY23 is expected to be between 24% and 26%.

**Hedging Program:** US\$350m of FY23 US\$ linked fertilisers sales are hedged at a rate of \$0.7418 with a further US\$240m hedged via a collar (cap of \$0.7500 and a floor of \$0.6184). All remaining US\$ linked fertilisers sales and offshore business earnings are unhedged and subject to the spot rate.

### **Principal Risks**

Set out below are the principal risks and uncertainties associated with IPL's business and operations. These risks, which may occur individually or concurrently, could significantly affect the Group's business and operations. For some of the risks described below, factors such as continuing global geopolitical uncertainty, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and global recessionary risks have the potential to exacerbate those risks. IPL is also undertaking a demerger to implement a structural separation of its fertilisers and explosives businesses to create two separately listed companies on the ASX. Some of these risks may be heightened for the businesses on a stand-alone basis.

There may be additional risks unknown to IPL and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial, which could become material. In addition, any loss from such risks may not be recoverable in whole or in part under IPL's insurance policies. The treatment strategies noted below are not exhaustive and do not remove the risks; while in some cases they may either partially or fully mitigate the exposure, residual risk remains.

The Group's process for managing risk is set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.

# <span id="page-37-0"></span>**ZERO HARM: OUR NUMBER ONE COMPANY VALUE**

Nothing matters more than ensuring our people get home safely every day. The safety of our people, customers, and community is our core value and integral to the way we work and operate.

Zero Harm is fundamental in everything we do – it is our core company value. This year we continued to work towards our ambition to achieve industry leading performance in occupational health, personal safety, process safety and reducing our impact on the environment.

Our safety performance is tracked against our three-year strategic plan which targets the delivery of global Zero Harm initiatives and is supported by our global collaboration networks.

### **2022 safety performance**

The **Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR)** has plateaued in FY22 with a Group TRIFR of 0.89. Even though our overall TRIFR target was not achieved, injuries that have resulted in serious harm have continued to decrease by 73% over the last three years, with zero fatalities for 2 years.

The Group focus continues to be on improving personal safety performance through maintaining operating discipline, effective visible safety leadership with quality safety conversations, and targeted injury reduction programs such as our Safe Hands campaign. Our SafeTEAMS training has also continued to be effective with our global workforce emphasising psychological safety and reporting to reinforce a learning culture.

We have been able to sustain our excellent environmental performance with **Zero Significant Environmental Incidents**  reported through implementation of key environmental compliance initiatives.

**Process Safety Incidents** decreased with 25 in FY22 compared to 38 last year delivering a year-on-year improvement of 31%. The significant improvement reflects the implementation of process safety improvement plans for both group and business units with continued focus on delivering effective operational risk management and learning from Significant Events. A detailed understanding of loss of containment process safety events has enabled the identification of effective strategies for further reducing the frequency of these events. (1)

The targeted performance in **significant event management** for investigations completed was achieved. The quality of our investigations has significantly improved with a focus on embedding our learnings with establishment of our Global Significant Event Governance Forum. We have also seen a significant increase in the hazard/near-miss-to-incident ratio in Significant Events, with a 94% improvement over the last 3 years, demonstrating continuous improvement in hazard awareness and reporting, and active learning from Significant Events to prevent harm to people and the community. Transport related Significant Events have also diminished as a result of implementation of controls and intervention strategies during FY22.

### **Keeping everyone safe from COVID-19**

Throughout FY22, we continued to operate in a COVID-19 environment with a key focus on both the physical and mental health and safety of our people.

This included the development of strategies to support our employees transition safely back to the office as lockdowns were lifted, ensuring business continuity, and supporting and encouraging vaccination of our workforce.

As we have been operating in a COVID-19 environment over the last two years, all required systems have been well integrated across our organisation. All reporting is now integrated into our standard HSE reporting protocols and monitored. The COVID-19 Crisis Management Team (CMT) was stood down in March 2022 and has the ability to be quickly re-instated if required.

Our People First Strategy (in place for the financial year period 2021 to 2023) was developed around four strategic themes: **Engaging Leaders**, **Talented People**, **Inclusive Workplace** and **Partnership**.

Delivering on our People First strategic commitments provides employees with a leadership experience grounded in a set of human principles that brings meaning and purpose to the work they fulfil, performed in inclusive, collaborative environments, offering growth opportunities that inspire and engage.

We encourage our People to participate through partnering with teams across our global footprint to share experiences and ideas at all levels of our organisation. We believe the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and it's through this principle that we build a strong, sustainable future for all stakeholders.

### **Strategic focus area 2022 highlights**

![](_page_40_Picture_1.jpeg)

We are committed to developing connected and aligned leadership with a deep understanding of the role we play in enhancing the health of our culture.

![](_page_40_Picture_3.jpeg)

We are committed to attracting and growing the best talent aligned to our strategic objectives and to deliver our business goals.

![](_page_40_Picture_5.jpeg)

We are committed to providing an inclusive workplace experience where our people have the space to authentically be themselves, collaborate, be curious and inspired to deliver.

**A review of the female leadership program**, **My Potential**, was conducted to ensure it continues to engage and develop our female employees in a meaningful way. Pilots of the revised program commenced in September 2022 in both the Americas and Asia Pacific regions.

The **Leadership Foundations program,** specifically designed for frontline leaders, started to be offered to US manufacturing sites and Australian operational sites and offices.

Provided opportunities to internal talent to retain skills and knowledge and continued to offer attractive career paths. Our **internal promotions increased by 12.6%**, demonstrating the depth of expertise and capability we have amongst our people. Our focus on candidates with diverse backgrounds continues as a key pillar in ensuring that we build a diverse workforce to deliver global outcomes.

The **Americas region launched a centralised Internship Academy** as part of the Nobel Academy program, with 67% of the interns diverse in at least one recognised category and 43% women.

Our **Australian Graduate Program** comprised 58% female engineers in 2022 and has had 0% turnover since the program began in 2018.

Inclusive behaviour remains a priority and we continued to build this capability. **Inclusive Leader & Respect in the Workplace programs** were conducted in the Americas region and the **Upstander Program** was utilised in Australia to further broaden inclusive behaviours.

Our **first cultural inclusion survey** was piloted in the Americas region to better understand our workplace culture as it relates to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. This approach is currently being considered for global implementation.

As part of delivering our Reconciliation Action Plan commitments in Australia we designed a **Cultural Awareness Program** delivered via e-learning. This program is focused on education and continuing to support our efforts in reconciliation and has seen excellent participation across the Australian business.

Our approach to **work flexibility** has matured to enable the balance between workplace collaboration and the shift in employees' expectations of work life balance. For employees in operational roles, we continue to seek opportunities to provide greater flexibility. For employees in nonoperational roles, we have a hybrid model allowing for office and homebased working arrangements (depending on the nature of the role). Our approach to flexible work is also underpinned by Flexible Work policies, enabling collaboration between leaders and employees to determine flexibility that works for the business and the employee.

In 2022, **female employees represent 18.5%** of our global workforce, a 0.8 percentage point increase on last year's figure and a 4.5% annual increase on last year's numbers. IPL's **Indigenous Australian workforce increased by 0.5 percentage points** to 2.9%, just short of its 3.0% target.

We celebrated the anniversary (July 2022) of our ammonia plant coming into operation and 10 years being part of the Moranbah (QLD, Australia) community. As part of the celebrations, IPL **donated two paintings by Barada Barna Traditional Owner Benjamin Isaacs** to Moranbah East Primary School and Moranbah State Primary School. The Moranbah State High School was also **gifted equipment including a lathe and welders** to help students progress their metal work skills.

Our efforts continue in Australia to **partner with our local traditional owners** to provide employment and training opportunities to indigenous individuals. In 2022, we launched the **IPL & University of Queensland Indigenous Scholarship Program**.

We continued our **American Australian Association Veteran's scholarship**, which provides education opportunities for veterans with future employment possibility.

# <span id="page-41-0"></span>**SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW**

### **Our sustainability strategy**

To deliver sustainable growth and shareholder returns while caring for our people, our communities and our environment.

IPL is committed to operating in a manner which acknowledges and proactively manages those issues which are most material to the long term sustainability of our business, our people, the environment and the communities in which we operate. This commitment is driven by our Company Values, which are core to our business, and built into our six Strategic Drivers.

In order to identify those issues most material for our stakeholders and our business, we conduct a biennial materiality review. The steps in this process follow Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, with our most recent materiality assessment conducted in 2021. This materiality assessment was designed to identify the broader megatrends that are currently shaping our operating environment and impacting the ways in which we create value. These are shown on the following page along with 2022 highlights.

During 2022, and in keeping with our announced plans to structurally separate our explosives and fertilisers businesses, we also reviewed our materiality assessment in terms of each of our business units, Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers. Our 2022 Sustainability Report will be released in February 2023 ahead of the Annual General Meeting and will describe in detail the megatrends and identified material issues and topics for each of these businesses, and how they are leveraging key environmental, social and governance (ESG) trends to create value. It will also describe the materiality assessment process, our key stakeholders and our stakeholder engagement process. Our annual Sustainability Reports and GRI Index and Data supplements can be accessed at <https://www.incitecpivot.com.au/sustainability/sustainability-report>.

(1) Our short and medium term absolute GHG reduction targets are set against our 2020 operational Scope 1&2 baseline of 3,991,396 tCO2 e. We have a medium term absolute reduction target of 25% by 2030 and we have identified projects which establish a pathway to a reduction of greater than 42% of operational (Scope 1&2) GHG by 2030.

(2) FEED represents the Front End Engineering Design phase of a project.

(3) Scope 3 emissions are indirect greenhouse gas emissions (other than Scope 2 emissions associated with purchased electricity) that result from activities at assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organisation, but arise from activities in the organisation's value chain.

{43}------------------------------------------------

### **Our use of natural resources in 2022**

### **Energy and GHG**

The manufacture of nitrogen-based products is energy intensive as it requires natural gas as both an energy source and a raw material, with carbon dioxide being liberated during manufacturing. For this reason, the production of these essential agricultural and mining products is currently based on a hard-to-abate chemical process.

Last year, we investigated new technologies required to decarbonise and developed a potential Net Zero Pathway to 2050. During 2022, we focussed on progressing a range of projects to meet our 2025 reduction target and to support a more ambitious 2030 target. Our 2022 progress has allowed us to:

- » Approve a project to underpin our **short-term absolute reduction target of 5%** of operational (Scope 1 & 2) GHG by 2025;
- » Identify projects that create **a pathway to a greater than 42% reduction by 2030**; and
- » Reaffirm our **ambition to achieve Net Zero GHG by 2050** or sooner if practicable.

**Total direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions**

During 2022, we also made significant progress on managing our Scope 3 GHG emissions, engaging a specialist third party to review our Scope 3 calculations methodology and reduction opportunities, and to investigate Science Based Targets for IPL and its businesses. For more detail on Scope 3 progress and the projects identified to support our operational targets see the Climate Change section on the following pages, and IPL's 2022 Climate Change Report.

Our 2022 global energy use increased by 11% since 2021 due to a 16% increase in ammonia production, as production recovered against major plant outages in 2021. This also increased our Scope 1 GHG emissions by 13%. Increased plant efficiencies reduced our GHG per tonne of ammonia by 3% on last year, which is an 11% reduction against our 2015 intensity baseline. Our purchased electricity and Scope 2 GHG emissions remained stable (changing by 1.2% and -3.8% respectively). Our Scope 3 Value Chain emissions decreased by 5%. (4) This data is shown graphically below.

### **Water Use and Discharge**

Cooling water is also a key necessity for nitrogen manufacturing. In addition to IPL's comprehensive annual risk management process and climate scenarios, the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Tool is completed each year for long term projections and reviewed by IPL's Chief Risk Officer.

Our 2022 total global water withdrawal increased by 16% on 2021 withdrawal, to 48,467 megalitres (ML). We discharged 29,648 ML to the environment, 95.7% of which was clean cooling water returned under EPA licence to the US rivers from which it was taken. This brings our net water use to 18,819 ML in 2022. For more details on our assessment of water risks and water management strategies, see IPL's 2022 Climate Change Report, currently available on IPL's website, and IPL's 2022 Sustainability Report, which will be available on IPL's website after its release in February 2023.

<sup>(4)</sup> IPL's 2020 Scope 3 baseline and 2021 Scope 3 emissions have been restated due to an external review which aligned our calculation methodology more fully with the GHG Protocol. This has resulted in an increase due to the use of LCA based 'cradle to gate' emissions factors for purchased products and the inclusion of emissions values for categories not previously included, such as employee commuting. See IPL 's 2022 Climate Change Report for more details.

<sup>(5)</sup> Although global electricity use increased by 1.2% since 2021, Scope 2 GHG fell by 3.8% due to decarbonisation of the grids from which we purchased electricity globally.

# <span id="page-45-0"></span>**CLIMATE CHANGE**

We recognise the challenge of reducing our own emissions while continuing to provide explosives and fertiliser products, through our Dyno Nobel and Incitec Pivot Fetilisers businesses, which help people grow by unlocking the potential in the Earth. We believe that innovative products and services will play an increasingly important role in reducing GHG, while increasing yields of food and fibre, and efficiently accessing the minerals and aggregates required for renewable technologies and infrastructure rebuilding in a world impacted by climate change.

Our Climate Change Policy describes how the management of the risks, opportunities and impacts associated with climate change is integrated into our six strategic drivers, on which the success of the Company is built.

Together with our policy commitments, these strategic driver components, shown in the diagram below, form the four pillars of our Climate Change Strategy. For detailed information on our governance, GHG reduction projects, Scope 3 strategies and management of risks and opportunities, including physical risks, see IPL's 2022 Climate Change Report.

### **Our Climate Change Strategy**

![](_page_45_Picture_5.jpeg)

### **OUR CLIMATE STRATEGY PILLARS**

**IPL'S SIX STRATEGIC DRIVERS** 

### **ENSURING STRONG GOVERNANCE**

**Talented and Engaged People:** The right people in the right roles, within a culture of innovation, with climate change management roles, responsibilities and accountabilities clearly dened.

#### **REDUCING OPERATIONAL EMISSIONS**

**Manufacturing Excellence:** Reduce emissions, increase eciencies and explore new technologies.

#### **DELIVERING PRODUCTS AND STRATEGIES THAT REDUCE SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS**

**Leading Technology Solutions:** Develop and deliver products and services which reduce customer GHG.

**Customer Focus:** Partner strategically for customer solutions and sustainable product use.

#### **MANAGING STRATEGIC BUSINESS RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES**

**Protable Growth:** Manage climate-related nancial risks and opportunities strategically.

**Zero Harm:** Build resilience to physical climate change risks and advocate for a just transition

### **Our operational GHG absolute reduction targets**

![](_page_45_Figure_19.jpeg)

<sup>(6)</sup> Absolute GHG reduction target is set against IPL's 2020 operational Scope 1&2 baseline of 3,991,396 tCO2 e which is based on IPL's current asset protfolio. IPL has identified a pathway to >42% reduction of operational (Scope 1&2) GHG emissions by 2030. Refer to Chapter 2 of IPL's 2022 Climate Change Report for further details on the key projects being explored.

(8) IPL's ambition to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050 is based on the Following assumptions: (a) green hydrogen reaches economic parity with natural gas for hydrogen production by 2040; and (b) carbon offsets are available for residual emissions that are not practical to abate.

<sup>(7)</sup> Funding for the Moranbah tertiary N2 O abatement project has been approved. The other projects remain subject to satisfactory completion of Front End Engineering Design and Final Investment Decision.

{46}------------------------------------------------

### **Our GHG reduction projects**

In 2022 we approved a project that will deliver our 2025 reduction target, progressed a range of proposed decarbonisation projects to develop a pathway to more than 42% by 2030, and moved towards setting Scope 3 targets.

![](_page_46_Figure_2.jpeg)

### **Pathway to more than 42% operational GHG reduction by 2030 (9)**

#### **Moranbah N2 O Tertiary Abatement**

Dyno Nobel's Moranbah ammonium nitrate manufacturing facility was built in 2012 with secondary N2 O abatement on the nitric acid plant. This has reduced GHG emissions by ~400,000 tCO2 e each year for the past nine years.

During 2022, IPL approved the installation of tertiary N2 O abatement, which will provide even greater reductions. A further ~200,000 tCO2 e will be abated annually, which equates to a 5% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline. The project is expected to be installed in 2024 and will underpin the achievement of IPL's 5% by 2025 reduction target. A similar project is being investigated for our Louisiana, Missouri AN facility which if adopted, would achieve a further 7-11% reduction against our 2020 baseline. (8)

### **Waggaman Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS)**

During 2022, a FEEDstudy was approved for a Carbon Capture Facility (CCF) at the Waggaman, Louisiana ammonia manufacturing facility. If adopted, the CCF would capture the pure stream of CO2 created during the ammonia manufacturing process. Due to its high concentration, this CO2 stream is much more economic to process than many other industries' CO2 streams, with only drying and compression required before transport via pipeline to a permanent geological sequestration site. Memorandums of Understanding (MOU's) have been established with several shortlisted parties to work through options for transport and deep well injection.

Louisiana is an ideal site for CCS due to its geology, its existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure, and a range of potential local partners with experience in using proven technology and management techniques to meet the very stringent regulatory requirements set by the US EPA for Class VI wells. Subject to the successful completion of the FEED study, and subject to a final investment decision, construction of the carbon capture unit at Waggaman is expected to begin in 2024 and be completed by the end of 2025. If adopted, this would result in a 22% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline.

### **Gibson Island Green Ammonia**

The Gibson Island Green Ammonia project is a partnership between IPL and Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) to investigate green ammonia production at the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers Gibson Island site. The site has used natural gas to produce hydrogen (H2 ) for the manufacture of ammonia (NH3 ) since it was built in 1969 (obtaining

the nitrogen (N) required from the air). The current model under consideration would involve FFI constructing an on-site water electrolysis plant to produce hydrogen from the electrolysis of water (H2 O) using renewable electricity, thereby dramatically reducing GHG emissions. FFI would develop and operate the hydrogen manufacturing facility, with IPL operating the ammonia manufacturing facility.

We are excited to report that the project progressed to FEED stage in 2022 and secured a \$13.7m ARENA grant. Should the project proceed to a final investment decision, it would be Australia's first industrial scale green ammonia production facility, demonstrating existing infrastructure can be retrofitted to utilise zero-emissions energy sources.

If adopted, the proposed water electrolysis facility would produce up to 50,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year and replace all of Gibson Island's current gas feedstock and 95% of its natural gas energy use. This would result in a 12% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline.

### **Investigating Science Based and Scope 3 Targets**

During 2022, we engaged a specialist third party to assist us to investigate Science Based Targets (SBTs) which are targets verified by the Science Based Target Initiative. Part of the work on the way to preparing SBTs includes an independent review of Scope 1, 2 and 3 calculations, as well as preparing Scope 1&2 and Scope 3 future emissions trajectories based on our business plans. An assessment of our proposed operational decarbonisation projects and Scope 3 reduction opportunities was also completed.

This work has confirmed our global Scope 1&2 emissions calculations with only minor changes. It also aligned our Scope 3 calculation methodology more fully with the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Calculation Guidance, resulting in a more complete Scope 3 inventory and baseline from which to move forward.

Our business units integrated Scope 3 emissions management into their business strategies this year, and are targeting FY23 delivery of a management framework with systems in place to track and manage Scope 3 by FY25. To assist, a supply chain partner with experience in Scope 3 has been engaged to assist IPL's businesses in obtaining supplier specific emissions factors and seek to work with value chain partners to collaborate on reducing Scope 3. For more information on our GHG reduction projects see IPL's 2022 Climate Change Report.

**2030**

(8) IPL's 2020 operational (Scope 1&2) baseline has been restated from 3,961,222 tCO2 e to 3,991,396 tCO2 e due to external verification of our global GHG data set by an expert third party.

<sup>(9)</sup> This diagram is not indicative of firm implementation timeline for each individual project.

{47}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-47-0"></span>**CARING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES**

Guided by our company value of "Care for the Community & our Environment", we continue to be committed to building long lasting and meaningful relationships with our local communities.

At IPL, we believe we have a responsibility to make a positive social and economic contribution to the communities in which we operate, by providing local employment, prioritising local suppliers whenever possible, and creating shared value for our urban, regional, mining and farming communities.

We support our site-based teams to engage with their local community members, business representatives, charities, governments, indigenous suppliers, and community organisations to ensure that engagement decisions are made locally and at the site level, where community needs are best understood.

Guiding our approach to community engagement, social investment, cultural heritage and working with Indigenous communities is our **Sustainable Communities Policy**, which outlines our commitment to:

- » listen to and work with the community;
- » strive to be a valued corporate citizen; and
- » respect our neighbours, their values and cultural heritage, and be considerate of them in carrying out our operations.

### **Community safety**

The safety of our people and the communities in which we operate must always come first, which is why IPL has robust safety measures in place to monitor, manage, and prevent any potential risk or impact to our workforce and the local communities in which we operate.

Due to the potentially hazardous nature of industrial and agricultural chemicals, IPL's on site staff are well trained to cooperate and engage with local community leaders and first responders on how to keep the community safe in the unlikely event of an incident.

In addition to our robust safety measures, many of our sites are required by law to communicate regularly with our communities regarding safety plans and emergency procedures. In the Americas, 64% of our sites fall into this category. These sites regularly engage with communities and first responders to share community safety plans and emergency procedures in the event of a potential incident. In the Asia Pacific region, 18% of sites also fall into this category. Some of these sites are classified as Major Hazard Facilities and these follow Safe Work Australia guidelines in communicating with their communities.

### **Community investment**

There are two key components of our Community Investment Framework. The first is our **Dollar-for-Dollar program**. It matches employee donations and site-based fundraising efforts (up to \$20,000 annually) where they align with our Principles for Giving.

The second is our **Workplace Giving program**. This is a voluntary workplace giving scheme for Australian employees whereby they can donate to one or more of the company's nominated notfor-profit charities with the assurance that IPL will match these donations up to a total of \$20,000 each year.

During 2022, \$691,937 of community investment was made globally through IPL's Dollar-for-Dollar program, the Australian Workplace Giving program and various site-based initiatives, including in-kind donations and employee volunteer hours.

100% of both local and Group donations were made in line with our Principles for Giving, with 2% allocated to improving education, 20% contributing towards health and sport initiatives, and 78% to local community development, including emergency and disaster relief.

![](_page_47_Figure_17.jpeg)

### **IPL Community Investment Framework**

Our framework preferences local approaches, enabling each IPL business and site to respond to the distinct needs of their communities.

**Education:** Providing support for childhood, adult and indigenous specific education activities.

**Health:** Providing support for activities and organisations working towards better physical and mental health.

**Community Development:** Supporting activities that enrich community life & enhance the environmental, social & economic sustainability of local communities.

**IPL Values:** We fund initiatives that are aligned to our values & business strategy and are integral to the sustainability of our communities.

**Local Initiatives:** We support initiatives that help local organisations develop skills & resources to bring positive and lasting benefits to communities.

**Local Sites:** We support activities that provide solutions to local challenges & opportunities in the communities where our people work and live.

{48}------------------------------------------------

### **Community activity highlights**

In FY22, IPL continued to host community events and activities to support the places that we live and work. A snapshot of events from our global community include:

### **IPL supports Queensland and New South Wales' flood affected communities get back on their feet, Australia**

From February to March 2022 north-eastern Australia was inundated with severe flooding events. In March 2022, IPL donated \$100,000 to GIVIT in support of their Storms and Flooding Appeal, which helped people who suffered devastating losses due to flooding in Queensland. These funds were used to buy essential items for over 90 families including beds, fridges, washing machines, kettles, toasters and much more.

IPL also donated \$100,000 to Rural Aid's Flood Appeal in support of Northern New South Wales and Queensland farmers who had been ravaged by catastrophic flooding. Rural Aid was able to support to these communities by providing counselling, financial and fodder assistance.

In addition, IPL employees generously contributed \$10,354 to GIVIT, which included fund matching by IPL. Delegates from IPL also purchased seats and attended Rural Aid's Long Lunch in April 2022.

### **Moranbah plant celebrates 10th anniversary, Australia**

IPL's Queensland based Moranbah plant celebrated 10 years of being a part of the community. The anniversary marks a long-term, genuine investment in the Moranbah community through both housing their workforce and continuing to be a major supporter of local initiatives and events.

As part of the celebration, IPL donated two paintings by Barada Barna Traditional Owner Benjamin Isaacs to Moranbah East Primary School and Moranbah State Primary School. Moranbah State High School was also gifted with vital equipment including lathe and welders for their Blue Shed workshop to help students progress their metal working skills.

### **Dajarra Campdraft, Rodeo & Gymkhana in Mt Isa, Australia**

IPL continued as the major sponsor for the annual Dajarra Campdraft, Rodeo and Gymkhana which was held in September 2022 in North-Western Queensland. It is one of the biggest bush and social events in the Mt Isa region. This year a team of 11 employees from IPL's Phosphate Hill site also volunteered to operate the canteen for the three-day event. All funds raised from the weekend go to help local community groups in the Dajarra area.

### **Celebrating Children's Day at Planta Austral, Chile**

Our Planta Austral site in Chile honoured the anniversary of the United Nations adoption of the Universal Declaration of the Rights of the Child. In August 2022, staff members were given presents to give to their children and gifts were donated to the Las Barrancas School.

### **Generator donation leads to United Way support, USA**

On 28 August 2021, Category 4 Hurricane Ida hit Dyno Nobel's Waggaman Plant and surrounding areas. Most employees and the plant were left without power for two to three weeks in sweltering summer conditions. Thanks to donations from Dyno Nobel plants from across the US, employees in need were supplied with a generator, allowing them and their families to live more comfortably.

Once life returned to normal in the Waggaman community, Dyno Nobel decided to auction the generators to their employees, so they could be used when needed. As a result of the auction, IPL was able to donate over \$12,300 to United Way, a local initiative which supports community programs in education, economic mobility, health and basic needs.

### **Porgera Memorial Golf Day, Australia**

IPL's team at Helidon continued the tradition of hosting the annual Porgera Memorial Golf Day. The day included 110 players as well as IPL volunteers who ensured the day went smoothly. The tournament included 'hole sponsorships' and prize donations which allowed IPL to raise \$18,000. Funds raised were split between Autism Spectrum Australia and the Salvation Army Christmas Food Appeal. Ongoing since December 2019, staff from the Helidon site also volunteer to collect food and pack and distribute hampers for the Salvation Army as part of the appeal.

### **Supporting Louisiana's youth, USA**

Throughout 2022, our Louisiana operations supported numerous initiatives towards children's health and wellbeing. Highlights include sponsoring a golf team for the Pike County Memorial Hospital Foundation's "Tee Off Fore Tots" Golf Tournament, where all raised proceeds were used to support the health needs of area children. IPL was also a sponsor for the Back to School Fair for the Pike Community Care Partnership. This program assists thousands of local children and families by obtaining much needed school supplies and backpacks. In addition to helping prepare kids for back to school, the partnership provides supplies to families in need throughout the year.

### **Thanksgiving meals provided to Wyoming families, USA**

Dyno Nobel's Cheyenne, Wyoming Nitrogen Plant employees buy, package, and deliver a full thanksgiving meal to 15 local families each year in November. The plant partners with CASA of Laramie County, a non-profit organization that advocates for children in the community. With CASA's help, families requiring support are identified and provided with a meal to celebrate the holiday.

### **Review and results of operations**

A review of the operations of the Company during the financial year, the results of those operations and the Company's financial position is contained in the OFR.

### **Significant changes in the state of affairs**

There have been no significant changes to the Group's state of affairs during the financial year other than as noted in the OFR.

### **Events subsequent to reporting date**

### **Capital Management**

On 15 November 2022, IPL announced a final dividend of 17 cents per share, 100% franked, to be paid on 21 December 2022. The record date for entitlement to this dividend is 6 December 2022. The total dividend payment will be \$330.2m.

On 15 November 2022, IPL also announced that it intends to undertake an on-market share buy back of up to \$400m. The proposed buy back will be conducted in the ordinary course of trading and the exact amount and timing of share purchases will be dependent on regulatory requirements and market conditions.

### **Strategic review of WALA and implications for structural separation of the Explosives and Fertilisers businesses**

On 15 November 2022, IPL announced that it has received a number of unsolicited approaches in relation to a potential acquisition of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA). The Company will undertake a review of the strategic options for WALA in the near-term. Under any scenario, IPL intends to maintain the strategic value of long-term supply of ammonia from WALA into the Dyno Nobel Americas business. An estimate of the financial impact cannot be made at this point.

The strategic review process will have implications for the timing of the proposed structural separation of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses which was announced on 23 May 2022. It is currently anticipated that the previously communicated target

completion date for the separation of early 2023 will likely be extended by 6-12 months, pending the completion of the strategic review process for WALA. There has been no impact on the financial statements for FY22 in relation to the proposed structural separation other than the costs incurred to date which have been classified as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Other than the matters reported on above, the directors have not become aware of any other significant matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the financial year, that has affected or may affect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent years, which has not been covered in this report.

### **Likely developments**

The OFR contains information on the Company's 2022 financial performance and prospects for future financial years, and refers to likely developments in the Company's operations and the expected results of these operations in future financial years. Information on likely developments in the Company's operations for future financial years and the expected results of those operations together with details that could give rise to material detriment to the Company (for example, information that is commercially sensitive, confidential or could give a third party a commercial advantage) have not been included in this report where the directors believe it would likely result in unreasonable prejudice to the Company.

### **Environmental regulation and performance**

The operations of the Group are subject to environmental regulation under the jurisdiction of the countries in which those operations are conducted including Australia, United States of America, Mexico, Chile, Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Turkey and France. The Group is committed to complying with environmental legislation, regulations, standards and licences relevant to its operations.

The environmental laws and regulations generally address certain aspects and potential impacts of the Group's activities in relation to, among other things, air and noise quality, soil, water, biodiversity and wildlife. The Group operates under a Global Health, Safety and Environment Management System which sets out guidelines on the Group's approach to environmental management, including a requirement for sites to undertake an Environmental Site Assessment.

In certain jurisdictions, the Group holds licences for some of its operations and activities from the relevant environmental regulator. The Group measures its compliance with such licences and reports statutory non-compliances as required.

Measurement of the Group's environmental performance, including determination of areas of focus and assessment of projects to be undertaken, is based not only on the actual impact of incidents, but also upon the potential consequence, consistent with IPL's risk-based focus.

During the year, the Group has continued to focus on licence compliance and identification and mitigation of environmental risks. Remediation works have progressed at a number of sites in Australia and the United States.

Environmental performance has maintained last year's improvement with zero Significant Environmental Incidents reported in the 2022 financial year. This result has highlighted the importance of delivering specific environmental improvement plans to achieve sustainable improvement. The implementation of our Compliance Management Framework and in particular the new Environmental Licence Compliance Procedure, with a continued focus on environmental compliance across the organisation through automation, increased controls, and improved practices has delivered improvement in our environmental performance.

{61}------------------------------------------------

During the 2022 financial year in Australia, two incidents (one at Mount Isa and one at Phosphate Hill) led to four Penalty Infringement Notices (PIN) being issued by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science. Along with a PIN received for an incident at Gibson Island which occurred in the 2021 financial year, the five PINs amounted to fines of AU\$65,148. Three incidents involved losses of containment from pipe networks to ground or to surface water. Corrective actions have been implemented for these incidents including clearer inspection and maintenance regimes and defined responsibilities.

At Gibson Island, the obligations and associated milestones under the two Environmental Protection Orders relating to stormwater release quality and groundwater contamination issued in 2021 have consistently been met during the year. These orders enforce commitments made by site operations to improve infrastructure, systems and materials handling to significantly reduce the risk of unacceptable releases to the environment.

In the United States, ongoing compliance monitoring and implementation of physical improvements at the Carthage and Louisiana, Missouri sites and St. Helens, Oregon are progressing to plan under two separate Consent Decrees. Regular reports are submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documenting the status of this progress and to date the sites have met all Consent Decree milestones. It is expected that the remaining tasks for both Consent Decrees will be completed by the end of calendar year 2022.

### **Indemnities and insurance**

The Company's Constitution provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company must indemnify any person who is, or has been, a director or secretary of the Company against any liability incurred by that person including any liability incurred as an officer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company and legal costs incurred by that person in defending an action.

The Constitution further provides that the Company may enter into an agreement with any current or former director or secretary or a person who is, or has been, an officer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company to indemnify the person against such liabilities.

In accordance with the Company's Constitution, the Company has entered into Deeds of Access, Indemnity and Insurance with each director of the Company and certain officer's and members of senior management. Pursuant to those deeds, the Company has paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring directors and officers of the Group against any liability for costs and expenses incurred by them in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such officers, with some exceptions. The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.

### **Auditor independence and non-audit services**

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte) was appointed as the Company's external auditor at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and continues in office in accordance with section 327B(2) of the Corporations Act 2001. Mr Tim Richards is the Company's lead audit partner for the 2022 financial year.

The Group may decide to engage the auditor, Deloitte, for the provision of non-audit services, where such services are not in conflict with their role as auditor and their expertise and/or detailed experience with the Company may allow cost efficiencies for the work.

The Board has considered the position and, in accordance with advice received by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, is satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by Deloitte is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and does not compromise the external auditor's independence.

The Board also notes:

- » the engagements for all non-audit services provided by Deloitte were reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer, and where relevant, approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, in accordance with the Committee's Charter and the Company's policy on the engagement of the external auditor for the provision of non-audit services to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and
- » the non-audit services provided by Deloitte did not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Group, acting as an advocate for the Group or jointly sharing economic risks or rewards.

Deloitte provided non-audit services to the amount of \$730k during the year ended 30 September 2022 (refer to note 24 to the financial statements).

The lead auditor has provided a written declaration that no professional engagement for the Group has been carried out during the year that would impair Deloitte's independence as auditor. A copy of the auditor's independence declaration is set out on page 83 and forms part of this report.

### **Proceedings on behalf of IPL**

No application has been made under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 in respect of IPL, and there are no proceedings that a person has brought or intervened in on behalf of IPL under that section.

### **Rounding**

As the Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, the amounts shown in this report and in the financial statements have been rounded off, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars.

The Directors' Report, which includes the OFR and the Remuneration Report, is signed in accordance with a resolution of the directors of Incitec Pivot Limited.

### **Introduction from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee**

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of Incitec Pivot Limited's (IPL or the Company) Remuneration Committee and the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for 2022 which sets out the remuneration information for the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer (MD&CEO), Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) and the Non-executive Directors.

### **Our approach**

The Remuneration Committee's objective is to ensure our remuneration framework provides a bridge between shareholder value and individual performance, whilst ensuring alignment with our other key stakeholders.

We ensure individual performance is measured using targets that align to IPL's values, long-term strategy and metrics, shorter term financial targets and relevant individual goals.

### **Financial Year 2022 in review**

The Company's safety and sustainability performance continued to gain positive momentum. Although TRIFR (1) has been flat, FY22 has seen a material reduction in injury severity and environmental incidents. This year we have made good progress on our journey to Net Zero with a range of projects advanced to decarbonise our operations. The Board and Management remain focused on continued progress to our sustainability performance.

The 2022 financial year was characterised by higher commodity prices, supply chain challenges, and ongoing COVID-19 uncertainties. These factors continued to make financial target setting very challenging. For financial year 2022, higher commodity prices helped deliver a record Headline Group NPAT result of \$1,027.1 million. With strong financial results the Company's share price increased 19.4% from \$2.94 to \$3.51. Pleasingly with increased profitability in 2022, dividends payments were increased 190% from 9.3 cents to 27 cents per share and a share buyback of up to \$400 million has been announced.

High commodity prices offset manufacturing related issues experienced at both our Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA) and Phosphate Hill plants. We remain focused on consistent and reliable production.

Some significant strategic steps have been progressed with the planned demerger of the fertiliser and explosives businesses, the acquisition of Titanobel in France, and assessments to convert the Gibson Island ammonia plant to run on green hydrogen.

Post the end of the financial year, the 2023 strategic objectives have been expanded to include the strategic review of the Waggaman ammonia plant. The strategic review process will have implications for the timing of the proposed demerger of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses. The deliverables for both projects have been incorporated into relevant executive strategic objectives for FY23.

### **Executive changes in FY22**

Mr Paul Victor commenced as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) on 1 July 2022. Mr Victor has over 30 years' experience across a range of industries, including upstream oil and gas, gold and coal mining, chemicals and energy industries for international listed companies. Former CFO, Nick Stratford, left the Company on 31 December 2021 (refer section 4.6).

Mr Stephan Titze (President – Incitec Pivot Fertilisers) has retired and left the Company on 30 September 2022 (refer section 4.6).

We thank both for their significant contributions to the Company.

### **Fixed remuneration in FY22**

A new regional manufacturing model was introduced this year. Duties for the previous Global Manufacturing & HSE (Health Safety & Environment) role were reassigned geographically to the President – Dyno Nobel Americas, the President – Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific, and the President – Incitec Pivot Fertilisers, resulting in increases to their fixed remuneration (refer section 2.2). The MD&CEO did not receive an increase to fixed remuneration in 2022.

### **Short-term incentive in FY22**

The MD&CEO achieved an STI outcome of 64% of maximum and the average Executive KMP STI outcomes was 59.3% of maximum. The STI outcomes were as a result of record Headline Group NPAT and strong performance by Executive KMP against their personal measures. Strategic objectives that have progressed well during FY22 include the planned demerger, acquisition of Titanobel and progress on decarbonisation initiatives.

HSE overall outcomes for the year showed improvement and achieved an at target result (refer section 2.3). Sustainability measures attached to each Executive KMP's STI delivered above target outcomes for all but the President – Incitec Pivot Fertilisers, who delivered a result between threshold and target. Group Adjusted NPAT (2) was impacted by manufacturing-related issues, which resulted in an overall outcome below threshold level.

For the Dyno business units, adjusted EBIT results for DNA did not reach threshold and DNAP was between threshold and target levels. The IPF business unit did not reach threshold for adjusted EBIT, largely due to Phosphate Hill production issues.

Section 2.1 outlines additional information on the Company's FY22 performance and resulting STI outcomes are provided in section 2.3 of this report.

### **Long-term incentive**

The 2019/22 LTI plan shifted its performance period for the Relative TSR condition from an end of financial year to a November 2022 testing date. The decision to move this Relative TSR performance period was to align the end of the testing period with the release of the Company's annual results.

As a result, only non-TSR performance conditions attached to the 2019/22 LTI plan can be commented on in this year's report (refer to Section 2.5), with detailed reporting on the 2018/21 tranche included under Section 2.4. The three metrics for the 2019/22 plan are Relative TSR, Return on Invested Capital, and Long Term Value Metrics. Although final performance for the Relative TSR component was not known at the time of this report, we expect a higher level of vesting for the 2019/22 LTI at around 60% to 80%.

As previously disclosed, for the 2018/21 LTI plan with the performance period that ended on 30 September 2021, 15% of performance rights vested.

### **FY23 Remuneration framework**

The FY23 STI remuneration framework is expected to remain largely the same as FY22. With the strategic review of Waggaman, timing of the demerger of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses is likely to be extended by 6 to 12 months (refer to section 5 for proposed FY23 STI weightings for each Executive KMP). After a recent salary review, the MD&CEO's fixed remuneration will be increased by 3.9% in January 2023, the first increase since January 2019. The performance conditions for the LTI 2022/25 are expected to be largely the same as the LTI 2021/24. We are reviewing the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) metric and expect to move to a three-year average calculation.

We continue to review market trends to ensure our remuneration framework supports the execution of our strategies to increase shareholder value. This objective is balanced with retaining and motivating our key talent and ensuring alignment with our other key stakeholders.

We look forward to ongoing dialogue with, and the support of our shareholders, and welcome your feedback and comments on any aspect of this Report.

#### **Minimum Shareholding Requirement**

Executive KMP are required to attain and maintain a MSR to better align Executive and Shareholder interests. It requires the MD&CEO to defer 50% of any STI awarded until holding the equivalent of 100% of Fixed Annual Remuneration (FAR) in IPL shares. This must be achieved within 5-years, or direct purchases of shares would be required. Other Executive KMP must defer 25% of any STI awarded until holding the equivalent of 50% of FAR in IPL shares.

#### **Total Remuneration**

The combination of these elements is designed to attract, retain and motivate appropriately qualified and experienced individuals, encourage a strong focus on performance, support the delivery of outstanding returns to shareholders and align Executive and stakeholder interests through share ownership.

### **2.1 Analysis of relationship between the Company's performance, shareholder wealth and remuneration**

In considering the Company's performance, the benefit to shareholders and appropriate remuneration for the Executives, the Board, through its Remuneration Committee, has regard to financial and non-financial indices, including the indices shown in the below table in respect of the current financial year and the preceding four financial years.

### **Table 2 – Indices relevant to the Board's assessment of the Company's performance and the benefit to shareholders**

|                                                                | 2018    | 2019   | 2020  | 2021  | 2022    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| NPAT before IMIs and excluding non-controlling interests (\$m) | 347.4   | 152.4  | 188.2 | 358.6 | 1,027.1 |
| EPS before IMIs (cents)                                        | 20.9    | 9.5    | 10.9  | 18.5  | 52.9    |
| Dividends per share (DPS) paid in the financial year (cents)   | 9.4     | 7.5    | 3.4   | 1.0   | 18.3    |
| DPS declared in respect of the financial year (cents)          | 10.7    | 4.7    | –     | 9.3   | 27.0    |
| Share price (\$) (Financial Year End) (1)                      | 3.98    | 3.39   | 2.03  | 2.94  | 3.51    |
| TSR (%) over 3 years (2)                                       | 14      | 30     | (37)  | (25)  | –       |
| On-market share buyback (\$m)                                  | (210.3) | (89.7) | –     | –     | –       |
| Equity Raising (net of cost) (\$m)                             | –       | –      | 645.5 | –     | –       |

(1) Share Price as at the end of the 2017 financial year was \$3.60.

(2) TSR is calculated in accordance with the rules of the LTI 2015/18, LTI 2016/19, LTI 2017/20, LTI 2018/21 as applicable over the three-year performance period, having regard to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the shares over the 20 business days up to but not including the first and last day of the performance period. For LTI 2019/22 the VWAP performance period is over the 5 business days immediately following the day that IPL's annual results are released in November 2022. This was not known at the time of printing and will be disclosed in next year's report.

### **Relationship between the Company's performance and Executive KMP STI outcomes**

The below graph shows the relationship between the Company's performance and STI awards for Executive KMP in respect of the year. For the 2022 financial year, Group NPAT (before IMIs and excluding non-controlling interest) increased by 186% to \$1,027.1m. The financial gate for the STI opened as outlined in section 4.3 of this report, resulting in Executives earning on average, 59.3% of Maximum 2022 STI awards.

![](_page_66_Figure_10.jpeg)

2022 Total STI awarded includes 4 Executive KMP and on average delivered higher outcomes than 2021 which included 5 Executive KMP.

### **Relationship between the Company's performance and Executive KMP LTI outcomes**

The below graph shows the relationship between IPL's TSR percentile ranking relative to its S&P/ASX 100 peer group over the three years that each plan operated, and the overall LTI vesting percentage that occurred for each plan. The LTI 2018/21 that vested in the 2022 financial year delivered 15% of total opportunity available for that plan. The 2019/22 outcomes will be outlined in next year's report (refer to footnote (2) under Table 2 above).

LTI Vesting outcomes are based on 3 year averages

{67}------------------------------------------------

### <span id="page-67-0"></span>**2.2 2022 Fixed annual remuneration**

The current policy for reviewing Executive remuneration is to use a primary benchmark against the market median of ASX companies with market capitalisation of 50% to 200% of IPL's, with support references against other benchmarking sources including the ASX100, and a select group of 21 S&P ASX listed companies from the Industrials, Materials and Energy Sectors (refer to Section 3.1 for more detail).

Market surveying specialist, HR Ascent, was engaged to source listed company remuneration data. The primary benchmarking was undertaken based on IPL's market capitalisation of \$5.65 Billion at 31 March 2021, which covered all ASX companies with market capitalisation of \$2.8 Billion to \$11 Billion as at 31 March 2021.

For roles located outside Australia, market-specific information sourced from US data providers Korn Ferry, Mercer and Equilar was used for benchmarking purposes.

The benchmarking analysis was considered along with the internal restructuring of the Global Manufacturing role that saw duties for this role reassigned geographically to the President – Dyno Nobel Americas, the President – Dyno Nobel Asia Pacific, and the President – Incitec Pivot Fertilisers, which delivered the following fixed annual remuneration (FAR) increases to these Executive KMP:

- » Ms Jeanne Johns received a 0% increase in the 2022 financial year and her most recent increase was in January 2019.
- » Dr Braden Lusk 16% (to US\$640,000, effective 17 July 2021). Dr Lusk's most recent increase prior to this review was in July 2020 when he was promoted to the role of President – Dyno Nobel Americas.
- » Mr Greg Hayne 15% (to \$770,000, effective 17 July 2021). Mr Hayne's most recent increase prior to this review was in October 2019.
- » Mr Stephan Titze 15% (to \$720,000, effective 1 January 2022). Mr Titze had not received an increase since joining the Company in January 2019.

The combined increases account for approximately 60% of the FAR that the President – Global Manufacturing & HSE was paid prior to exiting the Company. Increases for both Dr Lusk and Mr Hayne took effect in October 2021 but were backdated to when they assumed additional responsibilities in July 2021.

### **2.4 LTI 2018/21 outcomes**

The performance period for the LTI 2018/21 ended on 30 September 2021. Following testing against the performance conditions, the Board determined that 15% of the performance rights granted under the plan will vest (with the remaining 85% to lapse). Details in relation to each of the performance conditions are set out below.

#### **TSR Condition**

In relation to the TSR Condition, the Company's relative TSR performance over the period did not achieve median percentile performance of the comparator group of S&P/ASX 100 companies.

### <span id="page-69-0"></span>**Long Term Value Metrics (formerly Strategic Initiatives) Condition**

In relation to the Long Term Value Metrics Condition – the Board assessed this component against a balanced scorecard and determined the outcome partially achieved the performance goals across the entirety of the scorecard. The Board determined that 50% of the performance rights granted subject to this condition vested (out of a maximum of 30% of performance rights granted under the plan). Commentary on the performance against the scorecard is set out in the following table.

Stretch Between Target & Stretch Target Between Threshold & Target Threshold Below Threshold

### **ROE Growth Condition**

In relation to the ROE Condition, the Company's ROE Growth over the period did not achieve threshold performance of 7% compound. Accordingly, 0% of the performance rights granted subject to the ROE Growth Condition vested (out of a maximum of 30% of performance rights granted under the plan).

### **2.5 LTI 2019/22 outcomes**

The performance period for the Absolute ROIC and Long Term Value Metrics conditions of the LTI 2019/22 ended on 30 September 2022. The performance period for the Relative TSR condition will end after the disclosure of the Company's full year results in November 2022 and therefore after the date of this report.

In relation to the conditions that can be reported for the LTI 2019/22 to date, 30% allocated to Absolute ROIC will vest in full, and the 30% allocated to Long Term Value Metrics will vest at 50%.

Current projections are for the Relative TSR component (worth 40%) to partially vest as a result of surpassing 50th percentile performance against the ASX 100 index.

Total vesting of the LTI 2019/22 is therefore currently expected to be in the range of 60% - 80% of maximum opportunity.

Details on the number of rights vested and lapsed in relation to each of the performance conditions attached to this tranche, will be updated at the coming Annual General Meeting and reported in full in the 2023 Remuneration Report.

### **3. Executive Remuneration & Governance**

### **3.1 Executive remuneration overview**

In alignment with its remuneration strategy, the Board's policy on Executive remuneration is that it comprises both a fixed remuneration component (FAR) and "at risk" or performance-related components (short term incentive (STI) and long term incentive (LTI)) where:

- (i) the majority of Executive remuneration is "at risk"; and
- (ii) the level of FAR for Executives is benchmarked against that paid for similar positions at the median of comparator groups of ASX companies:

### **Comparator groups**

S&P ASX listed companies with market capitalisation between 50% and 200% of IPL market capitalisation (Primary Benchmark).

S&P ASX 100 listed companies.

A select group of 21 S&P ASX listed companies from the Industrials, Materials and Energy Sectors, selected on the basis of market capitalisation and related industry exposure, consisting of: Adelaide Brighton, AGL Energy, ALS, Ampol Australia, Atlas Arteria, Aurizon, BlueScope Steel, Boral, Brickworks, CIMIC Group, Cleanaway, CSR, Downer EDI, Fletcher Building, Orica, Origin Energy, Orora, Qube, Reliance Worldwide, Seven Group and Sims.

For roles located outside Australia, market-specific data is used as an additional reference point for benchmarking purposes.

### <span id="page-71-0"></span>**3.2 Executive remuneration strategy**

IPL's purpose is to unlock the potential in the Earth to help people grow. IPL embraces a set of Strategic Value Drivers that underpin the Company's business and form the platform for the Company's future earnings growth and shareholder returns. The Company's commitment to addressing climate change challenges and looking for opportunities in the decarbonisation of the world's energy systems is at the heart of the business strategy and integrated across all the Strategic Value Drivers:

**Zero Harm** – Broadening and setting year-on-year improvement objectives across key metrics including environmental care and process safety.

**Talented and Engaged People** – One IPL collaborative culture with engaged, diverse and inclusive teams focused on customers and value creation.

**Customer Focus** – Partnering with our customers to create added value and practical solutions for today and the future.

**Manufacturing Excellence** – Driving consistently high performance across all of our assets and investigating ways to address our greenhouse gas emissions.

**Leading Technology Solutions** – Innovation on the ground with practical innovations that our customers can use today to improve their operations and environmental outcomes.

**Profitable Growth** – Focus on opportunities that are distinctive to our differentiated technology, core markets, core capabilities and market segments.

Under the Strategic Value Driver of 'Talented and Engaged People', IPL recognises that to generate competitive returns for its shareholders, it requires talented people who are capable, committed and motivated. IPL's remuneration strategy is designed to support the objectives of the business and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward Executives of the requisite skill and calibre.

The key principles of the Company's remuneration strategy are to:

- » reward strategic outcomes at both the Group and business unit level that create top quartile long term shareholder value;
- » require integrity and encourage disciplined risk management in business practice;
- » drive strong alignment with shareholder interests through delivering part of the reward in the form of equity;
- » structure the majority of executive remuneration to be "at risk" and linked to demanding financial and non-financial performance objectives;
- » attract and retain the best available talent;
- » reward Executives for high performance within their role and responsibilities, and ensure rewards are competitive within the industry and market for their role in respect of pay level and structure; and
- » ensure the remuneration framework is simple, transparent and easily implemented.

### **3.3 Executive remuneration governance**

The remuneration of the Executives is set by the Board, having regard to recommendations from the Remuneration Committee.

Where appropriate, the Remuneration Committee of the Board engages external advisors to provide input into the process of reviewing Executive and Non-executive Director remuneration. For the 2022 financial year, the Remuneration Committee received market and benchmarking data from various sources, but this information did not constitute a remuneration recommendation for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

Further information in relation to the Board and the Remuneration Committee can be found in IPL's Corporate Governance Statement available on IPL's website.

### **4. 2022 Executive Remuneration Framework**

### **4.1 Overview**

The charts below set out the theoretical breakdown of the Executives' total remuneration package for the 2022 financial year. The FAR component is inclusive of cash and superannuation only, whilst "at risk" compensation is based on maximum entitlement that could potentially be awarded under the STI and LTI plans.

The restricted shares component of the STI (50% for the MD&CEO, 25% for other Executive KMP) must be deferred until an Executive's MSR is attained.

### <span id="page-72-0"></span>**4.2 Fixed annual remuneration**

Executives receive their fixed annual remuneration (FAR) in a variety of forms, including cash, superannuation, and any applicable fringe benefits. The Executives' FAR is set by reference to appropriate benchmark information for each Executive's role, level of knowledge, skill, responsibilities and experience. The level of remuneration is reviewed annually in alignment with the financial year and with reference to, among other things, Company and individual performance and market data provided by an appropriately qualified and independent external data specialist.

### **4.3 Short-term incentive**

The STI is an annual "at risk" incentive which is dependent on the achievement of particular performance measures. The following table summarises the STI plan that applied in the 2022 financial year (2022 STI):

| Is there an STI deferral<br>component? | A mandatory 25% STI deferral (50% for the MD&CEO) continues until an Executive's MSR is achieved. The MSR is 50% of FAR for<br>Executives (100% for the MD&CEO). All deferred shares are subject to a maximum 15-year sale restriction.                                                                                                                                                          |               |                           |                                      |                              |     |                       |                       |  |
| How is the STI delivered?              | The STI is delivered partly in cash and partly in the form of restricted shares. The split between cash and restricted shares is<br>determined based on each participant's shareholding under the MSR.                                                                                                                                                                                           |               |                           |                                      |                              |     |                       |                       |  |
| Was there a mechanism<br>for clawback? | The 2022 STI included a clawback provision, which requires the repayment of all or part of any STI awarded within three years<br>after a payment is made, in the event of a material misstatement or omissions in IPL's financial statements which results in a<br>restatement of the audited financial report, or where a participant has materially breached their obligations to the Company. |               |                           |                                      |                              |     |                       |                       |  |

### <span id="page-75-0"></span>**4.5 LTI performance conditions**

Details of the performance conditions for the LTI 2021/24 are set out below.

### **TSR Condition (40%)**

The TSR Condition requires growth in the Company's TSR to be at or above the median of the companies in the comparator group, being the S&P/ASX 100. This condition provides shareholder alignment as it takes into account the Company's share price movement as well as dividends paid, relative to other organisations comparable to the Company.

The S&P/ASX 100 has been chosen as the comparator group because, having regard to the business segments in which the Company operates and, specifically, the absence of a sufficient number of direct comparator companies, the Board considers the S&P/ASX 100 to represent the most appropriate, and objective, comparator group. It also represents the group of companies against which the Company competes for shareholder capital. The Board has the discretion to vary the comparator group at any time, including to remove companies from, or include companies in, the comparator group.

The table below sets out the TSR Condition, and the percentage of the performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition.

| Relative TSR ranking of IPL                                      | % of performance rights subject to the TSR Condition that will vest |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less than 50th percentile                                        | Nil                                                                 |
| At or greater than 50th percentile but less than 75th percentile | Pro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis                          |
| At 75th percentile or greater                                    | 100%                                                                |

### **Long Term Value Metrics Condition (15%)**

The Long Term Value Metrics Condition relates to the delivery of significant aspects of the Board approved strategy. The Long Term Value Metrics Condition comprises components aligned with the Company's strategic drivers: Manufacturing Excellence, Profitable Growth and Customer, Practical Technology & Innovation. Each of these strategic drivers has a direct impact on financial outcomes.

The table below summarises the Long Term Value Metrics components for the LTI 2021/24:

|                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Scorecard                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                               |  |  |  |

Details of the scorecards and specific performance goals for each component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition were notified to Executives on commencement of the LTI 2021/24 plan. Some of the performance goals involve commercial-in-confidence quantitative targets and, as such, some detailed performance goals are not disclosed, but performance against the goals is disclosed at the end of the performance period. For the LTI 2018/21, these details are set out in section 2.4. For the LTI 2021/24, the relevant details will be set out in the 2025 Remuneration Report.

The Board will determine the outcome for the relevant component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition under each LTI plan having regard to the results achieved against the performance goals across the entirety of the Scorecard for that component. If the Board determines that all of the performance goals in respect of a component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition have been achieved, all of the performance rights subject to that component will vest.

If not all performance goals in respect of a component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition are met over the performance period, the extent to which that component of the Long Term Value Metrics Condition has been satisfied (if at all) will be determined by the Board. In doing so, the Board will have regard to the results achieved against the performance goals across all of the components of the relevant Scorecard, without applying a specific weighting to any particular performance goal.

### <span id="page-76-0"></span>**Absolute ROIC Condition (35%)**

The Absolute ROIC Condition was introduced for the LTI 2019/22, to replace the ROE Growth Condition. ROIC has been selected as it is a key determinant of efficient use of the capital entrusted to management by shareholders. It also reflects factors that improve shareholder value, including operational efficiency, capital efficiency, asset utilisation and profitability. ROIC is defined as Net Profit After Tax, excluding interest and individually material items, divided by total invested capital (on a rolling 13 month average basis).

The table below sets out the Absolute ROIC Condition for the LTI 2021/24, and the percentage of performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition:

| Absolute ROIC Targets               | % of performance rights subject to the Absolute ROIC Condition that will vest |  |  |  |  |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|
| Less than 6.4%                      | Nil                                                                           |  |  |  |  |
| At or above 6.4% but less than 6.8% | Pro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis                                    |  |  |  |  |
| 6.8% or greater                     | 100%                                                                          |  |  |  |  |

### **Sustainability Condition (10%)**

The Sustainability Condition was introduced for the LTI 2021/24 as an additional metric. This Condition will measure the Company's organisational performance against the Sustainability strategy, and progress towards 2030 targets, and its development of a Scope 3 emissions reduction strategy. Key successes during this 3-year period will be driven by demonstrating material progress on implementation of the Moranbah tertiary abatement project, and the WALA sequestration MoU/project. The Board has the discretion to determine the vesting outcome between 0% and 100% for this Condition as it considers appropriate.

### **4.6 Executive service agreement terms**

Remuneration and other terms of employment for the Executives are formalised in service agreements. Most Executives are engaged on similar contractual terms, with minor variations to reflect differing circumstances. Each agreement is unlimited in term; however, each agreement provides that the Company may terminate an Executive's employment immediately for cause without any separation payment, save for accrued amounts such as leave, or otherwise without cause, with or without notice, in which case the Company must pay a separation payment plus accrued amounts such as leave.

The notice period to be provided by the Executives is set out in the table below:

| Current Executives          | Notice period to be<br>provided by the Executive | Notice period to be<br>provided by the Company |  |  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--|--|
| J Johns (1)                 | 52 weeks                                         | 52 weeks                                       |  |  |

### <span id="page-77-0"></span>**4.7 Performance related remuneration**

**Table 6 – Details of performance rights granted and vested in the year ended 30 September 2022 and the vesting profile of performance rights granted as remuneration.**

### **LTI**

Details of performance rights vested and forfeited set out in the table below relate to the performance rights granted under the LTI 2018/21 (performance period: 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2021) which, following testing in November 2021 resulted in the Board determining that 15% vested.

The 2019/22 LTI plan shifted its performance period for the Relative TSR condition to a November 2022 testing date. The decision to move this Relative TSR performance period was taken by the Board in 2019 to align with the Company's annual results and when the market is therefore its most informed.

As a result, only non-TSR performance conditions attached to the 2019/22 LTI can be commented on in this year's report (refer to Section 2.5 of this Report), with detailed reporting on the 2018/21 tranche included under Section 2.4.

(A) For the long term incentive awards, the value of rights granted in the year is the fair value of those rights calculated at grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The value of these rights is included in the footnotes under Table 7. This amount is allocated to the remuneration of each Executive over the vesting period (that is, in the 2022, 2023 and 2024 financial years). The maximum value of outstanding rights is based on the fair value of the performance rights at the grant date. This may be different to the value of the rights in the event that they vest. The minimum value of rights yet to vest is zero, as the performance criteria may not be met.

(1) Mr Victor commenced as CFO and was appointed a KMP on 1 July 2022. On commencement, he received performance rights with a fair value of \$269,000 in recognition of incentives forgone upon joining IPL. These will vest upon achievement of the performance hurdle over two tranches: 1 July 2023 and 1 July 2024.

(2) Mr Titze ceased as a KMP on 27 July 2022. Mr Titze's balance of rights represents the performance rights pro-rated according to his exit date of 30 September 2022.

(3) Mr Stratford ceased as a KMP on 14 November 2021. Mr Stratford forfeited all of his outstanding performance rights on his exit date of 31 December 2021.

### **Modification of terms of equity-settled share-based payment transactions**

No terms of equity-settled share-based payment transactions (including rights) granted to a KMP have been altered or modified by the issuing entity during the reporting period.

### **5. Overview of Remuneration Changes for the 2023 Financial Year**

A fixed salary increase to the MD&CEO of 3.9% has been approved for the new financial year. This will be Ms Johns' first increase since January 2019.

With the strategic review of Waggaman, timing of the demerger of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses is likely to be extended by 6 to 12 months. The proposed weightings of Executives' STI performance measures have been updated to ensure focus on both important projects in FY23. The MD&CEO, the CFO and the President, Dyno Nobel Americas now have specific objectives included within the Strategic Outcomes component of their STIs.

The proposed updated FY23 weightings for each Executive KMP are outlined below:

The ROIC component of the LTI 2022/25 is proposed to be updated from being calculated via a point-to-point methodology, to being calculated via a three-year average. This adjustment will account for intra-year movements in the forward budgeting of ROIC and aligns with the impacts of commodity price volatility.

### <span id="page-80-0"></span>**6. Non-executive Director Remuneration**

### IPL's policy is to:

- » remunerate Non-executive Directors by way of fees and payments which may be in the form of cash and superannuation benefits; and
- » set the level of Non-executive Directors' fees and payments to be consistent with the market and to enable the IPL Group to attract and retain directors of an appropriate calibre.

Non-executive Directors are not remunerated by way of options, shares, performance rights, bonuses nor by incentive-based payments.

Non-executive Directors receive a fee for being a director of the Board and Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman of the Board, receive additional fees for either chairing or being a member of a Board Committee. The level of fees paid to a Non-executive Director is determined by the Board after an annual review and reflects a Non-executive Director's time commitments and responsibilities.

For the 2022 financial year, there were no increases to Non-executive Directors' fees. Fees paid to Non-executive Directors amounted to \$1,690,000 which was within the \$2,000,000 maximum aggregate fee pool approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting. For the 2023 financial year, the Board has determined that there will be a minor uplift to fees paid to the Remuneration Committee, resulting from the increase in workload that this Committee has experienced over recent years. The Remuneration Committee Chairperson will now be paid \$40,000 (formerly \$35,400) with Remuneration Committee Members receiving \$20,000 (formerly \$17,700). This is the first alteration to the Non-executive Director fee schedule since 1 October 2014.

The table below sets out the Board and Committee fees that will be effective as at 1 October 2022:

| Chairperson                         | \$532,500                                                                                                                                       |

### **Cash flow hedging reserve**

This reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.

### **Share-based payments reserve**

This reserve comprises the fair value of rights recognised as an employee expense under the terms of the Long Term Incentive Plans.

### **Foreign currency translation reserve**

Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign controlled operations are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve. The relevant portion of the reserve is recognised in the profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of.

The foreign currency translation reserve is also used to record gains and losses on hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

### **Fair value reserve**

This reserve represents the cumulative net change in the fair value of equity instruments. The annual net change in the fair value of investments in equity securities (including both realised and unrealised gains and losses) is recognised in other comprehensive income.

### **Non-controlling interest**

This represents equity interest outside the Incitec Pivot Limited Group. Refer to Note 15 for the list of subsidiaries that are not 100% owned by the Group.

### <span id="page-90-0"></span>**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Basis of preparation**

For the year ended 30 September 2022

### **Basis of preparation and consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.

The financial results and financial position of the Group are expressed in Australian dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. Where applicable, comparative disclosures have been reclassified for consistency with the current period if material.

The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 15 November 2022.

#### Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The financial results and financial position of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date control ceases.

A list of the Group's subsidiaries is included in note 15.

#### Joint arrangements and associates

A joint venture is an arrangement where the parties have rights to the net assets of the venture.

A joint operation is an arrangement where the parties each have rights to the assets and liabilities relating to the arrangement.

Associates are those entities in respect of which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies of the entities.

Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost, and subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the investees.

The interests in joint operations are brought to account recognising the Group's share of jointly controlled assets; liabilities; expenses; and income from the joint operation.

A list of the Group's joint arrangements and associates is included in note 15.

### **Statement of compliance**

The consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (including Australian Interpretations) and the Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated financial statements of the Group comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (**IFRS**) and interpretations. The Company is a for-profit entity.

### **Key estimates and judgments**

Key accounting estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectation of future events that may have a financial impact on the Group and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the subsequent related actual result. The estimates and judgments that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities within the next financial year are set out in the notes.

### **Rounding of amounts**

The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 24 March 2016 and, in accordance with that Legislative Instrument, the amounts shown in this report and in the financial statements have been rounded, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars.

### **Global economic challenges**

Various global challenges including inflation, the war in Russia/ Ukraine, global supply chain disruption, tighter global financial conditions, renewed Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdown continue to pose future uncertainties. To date, the negative impact on IPL Group results has not been significant and no structural changes that impact the longer term operations and cash flows have been identified.

### **Structural Separation**

On 23 May 2022 the Company announced that it intends to implement a structural separation of its Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses to create two separately listed companies on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). There has been no impact on the financial statements for FY2022 other than the costs incurred to date which have been classified as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

### **Accounting standards issued**

The Group adopted any amendments to Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (**AASB**) that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current year. The adoption of these revised Standards and Interpretations did not have a material impact on the Group's result.

Certain new accounting Standards and Interpretations have been issued that are not mandatory for the 30 September 2022 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. These Standards and Interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.

The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates are being replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) as part of interbank offer rate (IBOR) reform. USD LIBOR will no longer be published after 30 June 2023. As at 30 September 2022, the Group has not transitioned any of its existing cross currency and interest rate swaps to alternative risk-free rates, however it is expecting to commence active transition of the existing cross currency and interest rate swaps portfolio to alternative benchmark rates (e.g SOFR benchmark rate) during the first half of FY2023. The Group is working closely with its Treasury system provider to fully manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates.

The group has assessed the implication of IBOR reform and expects the impact to be minimal.

(1) Demerger costs include transition support and advisory costs. One-off separation costs are expected to be in the range of \$60m – \$80m net of tax.

(2) The Gibson Island closure provision was increased by \$10m following a detailed review. The increase was primarily a result of contractor rate escalations since the provision was recognised.

### **Key accounting policies**

#### Revenue

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable by the Group. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue is recognised for the major business activities on the following basis:

- » Sale of goods and services: revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligations under the customer contract are satisfied. This is typically when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The fee for the service component is recognised separately from the sale of goods.
- » Take-or-pay revenue: revenue is recognised in line with the sale of goods policy. In circumstances where goods are not taken by the customer, revenue is recognised when the likelihood of the customer meeting its obligation to 'take goods' becomes remote.
- » Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.
- The Group disaggregates its revenue per reportable segment as presented in note 1, as the revenue within each business unit is affected by economic factors in a similar manner.

#### Goods and services tax

Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (other than receivables and payables) are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (**GST**). The only exception is where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the relevant taxation authorities. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as part of the item of expenditure.

#### Other income

Other income represents gains that are not revenue. This includes Government grants, royalty income and management fees from the Group's joint ventures and associates, income from contractual arrangements that are not considered external sales and government grants. IPL received Government grants during the year of \$48m to fund the increased production of AdBlue at the Gibson Island facility given the shortage in the domestic market. Grant income is recognised as a deduction from the related expense with any excess income reported as other income. Government grants received in advance are recognised on the balance sheet as deferred income and released to the profit and loss once the related expense is incurred.

### **Key accounting policies**

#### Income tax expense

Income tax expense comprises current tax (amounts payable or receivable within 12 months) and deferred tax (amounts payable or receivable after 12 months). Tax expense is recognised in the profit or loss, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity (as part of other comprehensive income). In this instance, the related tax expense is also recognised in equity.

### Current tax

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year. It is calculated using tax rates applicable at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.

### Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary differences and is calculated based on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised.

#### Offsetting tax balances

Tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legal right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

#### Tax consolidation

For details on the Company's tax consolidated group refer to note 23.

### **Key estimates and judgments**

#### Uncertain tax matters

The Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and foreign jurisdictions and as a result, the calculation of the Group's tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of certain items. In addition, there are transactions and calculations relating to the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for potential tax audit issues in deferred tax liabilities based on management's assessment of whether additional taxes may be payable and calculates the provision in accordance with the applicable accounting standards including IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, these differences impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

* Trade working capital is reported gross of debtor factoring and supply chain financing arrangements.

### **Key accounting policies**

#### Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of manufactured goods is based on a weighted average costing method. For third party sourced goods, cost is net cost into store.

#### Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial measurement they are measured at amortised cost less any provisions for expected impairment losses or actual impairment losses. Credit losses and recoveries of items previously written off are recognised in the profit or loss.

Where substantially all risks and rewards relating to a receivable are transferred to a third party, the receivable is derecognised.

To manage cash inflows which are impacted by seasonality and demand and supply variability, the Group has a nonrecourse receivable purchasing agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2022, receivables totalling \$94.9m (2021: \$124.2m) had been sold under this arrangement. The receivables were derecognised upon sale as substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser.

#### Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are stated at cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial year, which are unpaid at the reporting date.

To manage the cash flow conversion cycle on some products procured by the Group, and to ensure that suppliers receive payment in a time period that suits their business model, the Group offers some suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing. At 30 September 2022, the balance of the supply

chain finance program was \$173.1m (2021: \$207.9m). The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to have the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings. These indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary payment terms in the industry. At 30 September 2022, the Group has assessed that on balance the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements did not meet all of the characteristics to be classified as borrowings and accordingly the balances remained in trade and other payables.

### <span id="page-96-0"></span>**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: Shareholder returns**

For the year ended 30 September 2022

### **Key estimates and judgments**

The expected impairment loss calculation for trade receivables considers the impact of past events, and exercises judgment over the impact of current and future economic conditions when considering the recoverability of outstanding trade receivable balances at the reporting date. In establishing the expected impairment loss provision, the Group also assessed the impact of the global economic challenges and its potential to affect customers' repayment ability. Subsequent changes in economic and market conditions may result in the provision for impairment losses increasing or decreasing in future periods.

### **Franking credits**

Franking credits available to shareholders of the Company were \$7.3m (2021: \$10.1m).

### **Key accounting policies**

A provision for dividends payable is recognised in the reporting period in which the dividends are paid. The provision is for the total undistributed dividend amount, regardless of the extent to which the dividend will be paid in cash.

### **7. Capital management**

Capital is defined as the amount subscribed by shareholders to the Company's ordinary shares and amounts advanced by debt providers to any Group entity. The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and invest in business growth, while providing returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders.

The Group's key strategies for maintenance of an optimal capital structure include:

- » Aiming to maintain an investment grade credit profile and the requisite financial metrics.
- » Securing access to diversified sources of debt funding with a spread of maturity dates and sufficient undrawn committed facility capacity.
- » Optimising over the long term, to the extent practicable, the Group's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), while maintaining financial flexibility.

In order to optimise its capital structure, the Group may undertake one or a combination of the following actions:

- » change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and/or offer a dividend reinvestment plan with or without a discount and/or with or without an underwriting facility when appropriate;
- » return capital or issue new shares to shareholders;
- » vary discretionary capital expenditure;
- » raise new debt funding or repay existing debt balances; and
- » draw down additional debt or sell non-core assets to reduce debt.

#### Key financial metrics

The Group uses a range of financial metrics to monitor the efficiency of its capital structure, including EBITDA interest cover and Net debt/ EBITDA before individually material items. Financial metric targets are maintained inside debt covenant restrictions. At 30 September the Group's position in relation to these metrics was:

|                             | Target range           | 2022 | 2021 |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|------|------|
| Net debt/EBITDA (times) (1) | equal or less than 1.5 | 0.5  | 1.1  |
| Interest cover (times)      | equal or more than 6.0 | 20.3 | 9.7  |

(1) Consistent with IPL debt covenants, net debt does not include trade working capital facilities. The Group's capital management framework allows for a short term tolerance of 2.5 times for major growth opportunities.

These ratios are impacted by a number of factors, including the level of cash retained from operating cash flows generated by the Group after paying all of its commitments (including dividends or other returns of capital), movements in foreign exchange rates, changes to market interest rates and the fair value of hedges economically hedging the Group's net debt.

#### Self-insurance

The Group also self-insures for certain insurance risks under the Singapore Insurance Act. Under this Act, authorised general insurer, Coltivi Insurance Pte Limited (the Group's self-insurance company), is required to maintain a minimum amount of capital. For the financial year ended 30 September 2022, Coltivi Insurance Pte Limited maintained capital in excess of the minimum requirements prescribed under this Act.

### **Issued capital**

#### Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares issued are classified as equity and are fully paid, have no par value and carry one vote per share and the right to dividends. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax benefit.

Issued capital as at 30 September 2022 amounted to \$3,806.2m (1,942,225,029 ordinary shares).

### **8. Net debt**

The Group's net debt comprises the net of interest bearing liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, and the fair value of derivative instruments economically hedging the foreign exchange rate and interest rate exposures of the Group's interest bearing liabilities at the reporting date. The Group's net debt at 30 September is analysed as follows:

| Fair value of derivatives    | (18)  | 87.7           | (12.8)         |
| Net debt                     |       | 1,036.2        | 1,004.2        |

At 30 September 2022, the Group's Net debt/EBITDA before individually material items was 0.5 times (2021: 1.1 times). Refer to note 7 for detail on the key financial metrics related to the Group's capital structure.

### **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents at 30 September 2022 were \$763.5m (2021: \$651.8m) and consisted of cash at bank of \$264.5m (2021: \$251.9m) and short term investments of \$499.0m (2021: \$399.9m).

### **Key accounting policies**

#### Interest bearing liabilities

Interest bearing liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable borrowing costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with any difference between cost and redemption value recognised in the profit or loss over the period of the borrowings.

The Group derecognises interest bearing liabilities when its obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Any gains and losses arising on derecognition are recognised in the profit or loss.

Interest bearing liabilities are classified as current liabilities, except for those liabilities where the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the year end, which are classified as non-current.

#### Cash and cash equivalents

Cash includes cash at bank, cash on hand and short term investments, net of bank overdrafts.

#### Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs include interest on borrowings and the amortisation of premiums relating to borrowings.

Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, unless they relate to qualifying assets (refer note 9). In this instance, the borrowing costs are capitalised and depreciated over the asset's expected useful life.

### **Key accounting policies**

Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Borrowing costs in relation to the funding of qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the cost of the asset. Qualifying assets are assets that take more than 12 months to get ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds are borrowed, generally a weighted average interest rate is used for the capitalisation of interest.

Property, plant and equipment is subject to impairment testing. For details of impairment of assets, refer note 12.

#### Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis. Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation rates are calculated to spread the cost of the asset (less any residual value), over its estimated useful life. Residual value is the estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.

Estimated useful lives for each class of asset are as follows:

- » Buildings and improvements 20 50 years
- » Machinery, plant and equipment 3 50 years

Residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted where relevant when changes in circumstances impact the use of the asset.

### **Amounts recognised in the income statement**

Amounts recognised in the income statement relating to the Group's lease arrangements are as follows:

|              |       | 2022   | 2021   |
|--------------|-------|--------|--------|

| Total        |       | 50.3   | 48.1   |

### **Key accounting policies**

All leases except for short term or low value leases are recognised on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability. Short term (12 months or less) and low value leases are recognised in the profit or loss as a lease expense.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis in the profit or loss over the lease term.

Lease liabilities are recognised by the Group at the commencement date of the lease and are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Lease payments include fixed payments and variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate.

### **Key estimates and judgments**

Extension options - The Group considers whether an option to extend a lease is reasonably certain on a lease-by-lease basis, which considers the importance of the lease to the Group's operations and its economic incentive to extend the lease. The lease term is reassessed upon the occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstance.

Incremental borrowing rate – To calculate the present value of lease payments, the Group uses an incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the duration and the financing characteristics of the lease. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily available, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate applicable to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics.

Non-current **203.8** 197.5

### **Key accounting policies**

#### Goodwill

Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.

#### Brand names

Brand names acquired by the Group have indefinite useful lives and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment. They are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.

#### Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets acquired by the Group have finite lives.

They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

#### Subsequent expenditure

Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the asset to which it relates. All other such expenditure is expensed as incurred.

#### Amortisation

Goodwill and brand names are not amortised.

For intangible assets with finite lives, amortisation is recognised in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets in this category are as follows:

| » | Software           | 3 – 10 years  |
|---|--------------------|---------------|
| » | Product trademarks | 4 – 10 years  |
| » | Patents            | 13 – 15 years |
| » | Customer contracts | 10 – 17 years |

Useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted where relevant.

### **12. Impairment of goodwill and non-current assets**

### **Impairment testing of goodwill**

The Group performs annual impairment testing as at 30 September for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. More frequent reviews are performed for indicators of impairment of all the Group's assets, including operating assets. The 30 September impairment testing resulted in no impairment of any CGU as the recoverable amounts of the CGU's, being Fertilisers APAC, DNAP, DNA and Titanobel exceeded their carrying amounts.

### **Key assumptions**

Details of the key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations at 30 September are set out below:

| Key assumptions   |              | 1 – 5 years  | Terminal value<br>(after 5 years) |      |  |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|------|--|
|                   | 2022         | 2021         | 2022                              | 2021 |  |

| Gas (DNA CGU) (2) | 4.60 to 5.50 | 3.00 to 3.50 | 4.80                              | 3.50 |  |
| Ammonia (3)       | 528 to 1175  | 356 to 480   | 685                               | 454  |  |
| AUD:USD (4)       | 0.71 to 0.74 | 0.74 to 0.76 | 0.73                              | 0.74 |  |

(1) Di-Ammonium Phosphate price (FOB China/Saudi – USD per tonne).

(2) Henry Hub natural gas price (USD per mmbtu). (3) Ammonia price (CFR Tampa – USD per tonne).

(4) AUD:USD exchange rate.

For both DNAP and Fertilisers APAC, the gas price assumption for impairment testing purposes for the first period after the current gas contracts expire, is based on external long term gas production cost forecasts of between \$8.64 and \$9.63 per gigajoule.

Fertiliser prices, foreign exchange rates and natural gas prices are estimated by reference to external market publications and market analyst estimates where available, and are updated at each reporting date.

#### Discount and growth rates

The post-tax discount rate used in the calculations is 9% for the Fertilisers APAC CGU (2021: 9%), 8.5% for the DNA and DNAP CGUs (2021: 8.5%) and 9% for the Titanobel CGU. The rate reflects the underlying cost of capital adjusted for market and asset specific risks.

The terminal value growth rate represents the forecast consumer price index (CPI) of 2.5% (2021: 2.5%) for all CGUs. Sensitivity analyses on the discount and growth rates, considering the current volatile market conditions, are provided below.

Carbon price impact and Investment in Sustainability

The commodity forecast assumptions used in the impairment models were obtained from external sources which include the impacts of sustainability and carbon costs.

Capital forecasts in the cash flows used in the impairment models include investment in sustainability related projects that have either commenced or are committed, including the earnings attributable to these capital projects.

For the year ended 30 September 2022

#### Sensitivity analyses

Included in the table below is a sensitivity analysis of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and, where applicable, the impairment charge considering reasonable change scenarios relating to key assumptions at 30 September 2022.

Each of the sensitivities below assumes that a specific assumption moves in isolation, while all other assumptions are held constant. A change in one assumption could be accompanied by a change in another assumption, which may increase or decrease the net impact.

### **Impairment of other property, plant and equipment**

During the year ended 30 September 2022 other property, plant and equipment was impaired by \$4.5m (2021: \$3.2m) as a result of the Group's fixed asset verification procedures. Additional impairment of \$209.9m in relation to the Cheyenne and Gibson Island facilities was recognised as an Individually Material Item in the prior year.

### **Key accounting policies**

#### Impairment testing

The identification of impairment indicators involves management judgment. Where an indicator of impairment is identified, a formal impairment assessment is performed. The Group's annual impairment testing determines whether the recoverable amount of a CGU or group of CGUs, to which goodwill and/or indefinite life intangible assets are allocated, exceeds its carrying amount.

A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash flows largely independent of cash flows of other groups of assets. Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs which are no larger than one of the Group's reportable segments.

#### Determining the recoverable amount

The recoverable amount of an asset is determined as the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is a term that means an asset's value based on the expected future cash flows arising from its continued use in its current condition, discounted to present value. For discounting purposes, a post-tax rate is used that reflects current market assessments of the risks specific to the asset. The Group has prepared value-in-use models for the purpose of impairment testing as at 30 September 2022, using five year discounted cash flow models based on Board approved forecasts. Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a terminal value growth rate.

Transition of the world's energy systems and sustainability forms part of our strategy and these have been considered in the market data utilised to assess growth rates for each CGU.

#### Impairment losses

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset (or its CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated against assets in the following order:

- » Firstly, against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU.
- » Secondly, against the carrying amount of any remaining assets in the CGU.

An impairment loss recognised in a prior period for an asset (or its CGU) other than goodwill may be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset (or its CGU) since the last impairment loss was recognised. When this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset (or its CGU) is increased to its recoverable amount.

{105}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-105-0"></span>For the year ended 30 September 2022

### **Key estimates and judgments**

The Group is required to make significant estimates and judgments in determining whether the carrying amount of its assets and/or CGUs has any indication of impairment, in particular in relation to:

- » key assumptions used in forecasting future cash flows;
- » discount rates applied to those cash flows; and
- » the expected long term growth in cash flows.

Such estimates and judgments are subject to change as a result of changing economic, operational, environmental and weather conditions. Actual cash flows may therefore differ from forecasts and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods.

### **Key accounting policies**

Provisions are measured at management's estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. This estimate is based on a "present value" calculation, which involves the application of a discount rate to the expected future cash flows associated with settlement. The discount rate takes into account factors such as risks specific to the liability and the time value of money.

#### Employee entitlements

Provisions are made for liabilities to employees for annual leave, long service leave and other employee entitlements. Where the payment to employees is expected to take place in 12 months time or later, a present value calculation is performed. In this instance, the corporate bond rate is used to discount the liability to its present value.

#### Restructuring and rationalisation

Provisions for restructuring or rationalisation are only recognised when a detailed plan has been approved and the restructuring or rationalisation has either commenced or been publicly announced.

#### Environmental

Provisions relating to the remediation of soil, groundwater, untreated waste and other environmental contamination are made when the Group has an obligation to carry out the clean-up operation as a result of a past event. In addition, a provision will only be made where it is possible to reliably estimate the costs involved.

#### Asset retirement

In certain circumstances, the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove an asset and to restore the site on which it is located. The present value of the estimated costs of this process is recognised as part of the asset that is depreciated and also as a provision.

At each reporting date, the provision is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates and the timing and amount of future estimated cash flows. Any changes in the provision are added to or deducted from the related asset, other than changes associated with the passage of time. This is recognised as a borrowing cost in the profit or loss.

#### Legal and other

There are a number of legal claims and other exposures, including claims for damages arising from products and services supplied by the Group, that arise from the ordinary course of business. A provision is only made where it is probable that a payment or restitution will be required and the costs involved can be reliably estimated.

For example, in April 2022, a jury awarded damages of US\$46.75m (comprising punitive damages US\$30m and compensatory damages US\$16.75m) to a plaintiff in a personal injury legal case in the DNA business in relation to a nitrogen oxide release at one of its plants in 2015. In relation to this particular matter, the Company intends to vigorously pursue all available review and appeal rights.

### **Key estimates and judgments**

Provisions are based on the Group's estimate of the timing and value of outflows of resources required to settle or satisfy commitments and liabilities known to the Group at the reporting date.

### **Contingencies**

The following contingent liabilities are considered unlikely. However the directors consider they should be disclosed:

- » Under the terms of the ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC Corporations (Wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 17 December 2016, which relieved certain wholly-owned subsidiaries from the requirement to prepare audited financial statements, IPL and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (identified in note 15) have entered into an approved deed for the cross guarantee of liabilities. No additional liabilities subject to the Deed of Cross Guarantee at 30 September 2022 are expected to arise to IPL or the relevant subsidiaries.
- » The Group is regularly subject to investigations and audit activities by the revenue authorities of jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The outcome of these investigations and audits depends upon several factors which may result in further tax payments or refunds of tax payments already made by the Group over and above existing provisions. Refer to note 3 for further details.
- » Contingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business and include a number of legal claims, environmental cleanup requirements and bank guarantees.

The Directors are of the opinion that no additional provisions are required in respect of these matters, as it is either not probable that a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required or the amount is not capable of reliable measurement.

### **18. Financial risk management**

The Group is exposed to financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk. This note explains the Group's financial risk exposures and its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.

The Board of Directors (the **Board**) has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Board established the Audit and Risk Management Committee (**ARMC**) which is responsible for, amongst other things, the monitoring of the Group's risk management plans. The ARMC is assisted in its oversight role by the Group's Risk Management function. The Risk Management function performs reviews of the Group's risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the ARMC. The ARMC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.

The Group's financial risk management framework includes policies to identify, analyse and manage the Group's financial risks. These policies set appropriate financial risk limits and controls, identify permitted derivative instruments and provide guidance on how to monitor and report financial risks and adherence to set limits. Financial risk management policies, procedures and systems are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain appropriate given changes in market conditions and/or the Group's activities.

### **Financial risks**

**Liquidity risk:** The risk that the Group is not able to refinance its debt obligations or meet other cash outflow obligations when required.

#### Source of risk

Exposure to liquidity risk derives from the Group's operations and from the external interest bearing liabilities that it holds.

#### Risk mitigation

Liquidity risk is managed by ensuring there are sufficient committed funding facilities available to meet the Group's financial commitments in a timely manner.

The Group's forecast liquidity requirements are continually reassessed based on regular forecasting of earnings and capital requirements.

This includes stress testing of critical assumptions such as input costs, sales prices, production volumes, exchange rates and capital expenditure.

The Group aims to hold a minimum liquidity buffer of at least \$500m in undrawn non-current committed funding to meet any unforeseen cash flow requirements. Details on the Group's committed finance facilities, including the maturity dates of these facilities, are included in note 8.

### Outstanding financial instruments

The Group's exposures to liquidity risk are set out in the tables below:

{111}------------------------------------------------

For the year ended 30 September 2022

**Market risk:** The risk that changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the Group's earnings, cash flows and the carrying values of its financial instruments.

### **Foreign exchange risk**

#### Source of risk

The Group is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates (primarily in USD) on the following transactions and balances:

- » Sales and purchases
- » Trade receivables and trade payables
- » Interest bearing liabilities

The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange movements (primarily in USD) on the translation of the earnings, assets and liabilities of its foreign operations.

#### Risk mitigation

Foreign exchange exposure to sales and purchases is managed by entering into formal hedging arrangements.

The Group hedges both specific transactions and net exposures by entering into foreign exchange rate derivative contracts.

The translation risk of USD denominated interest bearing liabilities and net investments in foreign operations and their earnings is also managed by entering into foreign exchange rate derivative financial instruments.

### Outstanding financial instruments and sensitivity analysis

The fertiliser sales sensitivity calculation is based on actual tonnes manufactured by the Australian fertiliser plants and sold during the year, the average AUD:USD exchange rate for the year, and the average USD fertiliser price.

The North American earnings translation sensitivity calculation is based on the earnings before interest and tax from the North American business for the year and the average AUD:USD exchange rate for the year.

### **Market risk**

### **Interest rate risk**

#### Source of risk

Exposure to interest rate risk is a result of the effect of changes in interest rates on the Group's outstanding interest bearing liabilities and derivative instruments.

#### Risk mitigation

The exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable interest rate borrowings and by entering into interest rate derivative instruments.

### Outstanding financial instruments and sensitivity analysis

The tables below include the Group's derivative contracts that are exposed to changes in interest rates at 30 September:

Interest rate sensitivity on outstanding financial instruments

The following table shows the sensitivity of the Group's profit before tax to a 1 per cent change in interest rates. The sensitivity is calculated based on the Group's interest bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate movements and the AUD:USD exchange rate at 30 September:

| Interest rate sensitivity | + 1%<br>AUD mill<br>2022 | - 1%<br>AUD mill<br>2022 | + 1%<br>AUD mill<br>2021 | - 1%<br>AUD mill<br>2021 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| LIBOR                     | (5.6)                    | 5.6                      | (7.7)                    | 7.7                      |
| BBSW                      | (2.8)                    | 2.8                      | 0.7                      | (0.7)                    |

The sensitivity above is also representative of the Group's interest rate exposures during the year.

{113}------------------------------------------------

For the year ended 30 September 2022

### **Market risk**

### **Commodity price risk**

#### Source of risk

Exposure to changes in commodity prices is by virtue of the products that the Group sells and its manufacturing operations, and can be categorised into five main commodities, namely: Ammonia, Ammonium Nitrate, Ammonium Phosphate, Urea and Natural Gas.

#### Risk mitigation

Where possible, commodity price risk exposure is managed by entering into long term contracts with customers (i.e Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonia) or derivative contracts for input cost (i.e US natural gas). However, in some instances price risk exposure cannot be economically mitigated by either contractual arrangements or derivative contracts by virtue of the products that the Group sells.

### Outstanding financial instruments and sensitivity analysis

The table below includes the Group's derivative contracts that are exposed to changes in natural gas prices at 30 September:

(1) Gains or losses recognised in the reserves will be reclassified to the same line item in the profit or loss as the underlying hedged item when the underlying forecast transaction occurs.

(2) Gains or losses on discontinued hedges that were in cash flow hedge or net investment hedge relationships remain in the reserves until the underlying transactions occur or upon disposal of the underlying net investment. Any changes in the market value of the discontinued hedges are recognised in the profit or loss from discontinuation.

(3) Interest rate swap contracts effectively convert USD500m, AUD181m and HKD560m of the Group's fixed interest rate borrowings to floating interest rates. The fair value hedge adjustment of a hedged item where the hedging instrument is discontinued remains in the carrying amount of the hedged item and is amortised to the profit or loss over the life of the hedged item.

(4) At 30 September 2022, there were no gains/losses that were transferred from reserves to profit or loss in relation to ineffective hedges.

(1) Gains or losses recognised in the reserves will be reclassified to the same line item in the profit or loss as the underlying hedged item when the underlying forecast transaction occurs.

(2) Gains or losses on discontinued hedges that were in cash flow hedge or net investment hedge relationships remain in the reserves until the underlying transactions occur or upon disposal of the underlying net investment. Any changes in the market value of the discontinued hedges are recognised in the profit or loss from discontinuation.

(3) Interest rate swap contracts effectively convert USD500m, AUD181m and HKD560m of the Group's fixed interest rate borrowings to floating interest rates. The fair value hedge adjustment

of a hedged item where the hedging instrument is discontinued remains in the carrying amount of the hedged item and is amortised to the profit or loss over the life of the hedged item. (4) Derivatives which are classified as held for trading are in economic hedge relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These hedges are effective economic hedges or offsetting hedges based on contractual amounts and cash flows over the life of the underlying item.

(5) At 30 September 2021, there were no gains/losses that were transferred from reserves to profit or loss in relation to ineffective hedges.

**Credit risk:** The risk of financial loss to the Group as a result of customers or counterparties to financial assets failing to meet their contractual obligations.

#### Source of risk

The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk from trade and other receivables and financial instrument contracts that are outstanding at the reporting date.

#### Risk mitigation

The Group minimises the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables balances by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers in various countries.

The creditworthiness of customers is reviewed prior to granting credit, using trade references and credit reference agencies. Credit limits are established and monitored for each customer, and these limits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can reach. Trade credit insurance is purchased when required.

The Group mitigates credit risk from financial instrument contracts by only entering into transactions with counterparties that have sound credit ratings and, where applicable, with whom the Group has a signed netting agreement. Given their high credit ratings, the Group does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.

### **Fair value**

Fair value of the Group's financial assets and liabilities is calculated using a variety of techniques depending on the type of financial instrument as follows:

- » The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities traded in active markets (such as equity securities and fixed interest rate bonds) is the quoted market price at the reporting date.
- » The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities not traded in active markets is calculated using discounted cash flows. Future cash flows are calculated based on observable forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
- » The fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward contracts is calculated using discounted cash flows, reflecting the credit risk of various counterparties. Future cash flows are calculated based on the contract rate, observable forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
- » The fair value of option contracts is calculated using the contract rates and observable market rates at the end of the reporting period, reflecting the credit risk of various counterparties. The valuation technique is consistent with the Black-Scholes methodology and utilises Monte Carlo simulations.
- » The fair value of commodity swaps and commodity forward contracts is calculated using their quoted market price, where available. If a quoted market price is not available, then fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on the difference between the contractual price and the current observable market price, reflecting the credit risk of various counterparties. These future cash flows are then discounted to present value.
- » The nominal value less expected credit losses of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short term maturity.

#### Credit risk exposure

The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 September is the carrying amount, net of any provision for impairment, of the financial assets as detailed in the table below:

|                             | 2022    | 2021    |
|-----------------------------|---------|---------|
|                             | \$mill  | \$mill  |
| Trade and other receivables | 785.3   | 517.0   |
| Cash and cash equivalents   | 763.5   | 651.8   |
| Derivative assets           | 37.3    | 86.0    |
|                             | 1,586.1 | 1,254.8 |

Financial assets and financial liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and are intended to be settled on a net basis are offset in the Statement of Financial Position. At 30 September 2022, the amount netted in other financial assets and other financial liabilities is \$79.8m (2021: nil).

#### Fair value hierarchy

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:

- » Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- » Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- » Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Derivative financial assets      | –      | 86.0   | –      |
| Derivative financial liabilities | –      | (93.5) | –      |
| Investment in Equity Instrument  | –      | –      | 3.0    |

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost

Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost which equals their fair value.

Interest bearing liabilities are carried at amortised cost and have a carrying value of \$1,712.0m (2021: \$1,668.8m) – refer to note 8. The fair value of the interest bearing financial liabilities at 30 September 2022 was \$1,655.0m (2021: \$1,763.5m) and was based on the level 2 valuation methodology.

#### Foreign currency transactions and balances

The Group presents its accounts in Australian dollars. Foreign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the date the transaction occurs.

Monetary assets (such as trade receivables) and liabilities (such as trade creditors) denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rate at 30 September. Non-monetary items (for example, plant and machinery) that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.

Foreign exchange gains and losses relating to transactions are recognised in the profit or loss with the exception of gains and losses arising from cash flow hedges and net investment hedges that are recognised in other comprehensive income.

#### Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated at applicable exchange rates at 30 September. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on translation are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve (**FCTR**). If and when the Group disposes of the foreign operation, these gains and losses are transferred from the FCTR to the profit or loss.

#### Derivatives and hedging

The Group uses contracts known as derivative financial instruments to hedge its financial risk exposures.

On entering into a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents details of the hedge, risk management objective and strategy for entering into the arrangement. The Group applies hedge accounting to hedging relationships that are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value, i.e. where the cash flows arising from the hedge instrument closely match the cash flows arising from the hedged item.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when:

- » The hedging relationship no longer meets the risk management objective.
- » The hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
- » The hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

Derivatives are measured at fair value. The accounting treatment applied to specific types of hedges is set out below.

#### Cash flow hedges

Changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognised in equity, in the cash flow hedge reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in the profit or loss.

Fair value gains or losses accumulated in the reserve are taken to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount recognised in the reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is purchased.

#### Net investment hedges

Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are accounted for in a similar way as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the hedge are recognised directly in equity (in the FCTR) while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the profit or loss.

On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of gains or losses recognised in the FCTR are transferred to profit or loss.

#### Fair value hedges

The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item are recognised in the profit or loss.

#### Hedge ineffectiveness

The Group aims to transact only highly effective hedge relationships, and in most cases the hedging instruments have a 1:1 hedge ratio with the hedged items. However, at times, some hedge ineffectiveness can arise and is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it occurs. Key sources of hedge ineffectiveness for the Group are as follows:

- » Maturity dates of hedging instruments not matching the maturity dates of the hedged items.
- » Credit risk inherent within the hedging instrument not matching the movement in the hedged item.
- » Interest rates of the Group's financing facilities not matching the interest rates of the hedging instrument.
- » Forecast transactions not occurring.

#### Classification of financial instruments

Financial instruments are classified into the following categories:

- » Amortised cost (cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing liabilities and trade and other receivables and payables).
- » Fair value through other comprehensive income (listed equity securities).
- » Fair value through profit or loss (derivative financial instruments except those that are in a designated hedge relationship).

### **19. Share-based payments**

### **Incentive Plans**

The Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIs) are designed to link reward with the key performance drivers that underpin sustainable growth in shareholder value. With regard to the 2019/22, 2020/23 and 2021/24 LTIs, the performance conditions comprise relative total shareholder return, the delivery of certain long term value metrics, absolute return on invested capital and sustainability conditions for the LTI 2021/24 plan.

Certain Executives have been awarded performance rights under Short Term Incentive Plans (STIs) based on financial, safety and strategic outcomes.

These arrangements support the Company's strategy for retention and motivation of its executives.

### **Expenses arising from share-based payment transactions**

Total expenses arising from share-based payment transactions recognised during the period as part of employee benefit expense were as follows:

|                                                                                          | 2022<br>\$mill | 2021<br>\$mill |

| Number of performance rights outstanding<br>under the LTI and STI performance plans      | 5,887,136      | 6,285,054      |

Details of the movements in LTI and STI performance rights are disclosed in the Remuneration Report.

### **Key accounting policies**

The rights to shares granted to employees under the terms of the plans are measured at fair value. The fair value is recognised as an employee expense over the period that employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights. There is a corresponding increase in equity, which is reflected in the share based payments reserve.

The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of rights taken up, once related service and other non-market conditions are met.

### **Key assumptions and sensitivities**

### **Principal actuarial assumptions**

|                              | 2022        | 2021        |
|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Discount rate (gross of tax) | 5.0% - 7.7% | 2.3% – 7.7% |
| Future salary increases      | 3.5% - 5.0% | 2.0% – 5.0% |

### **Sensitivity analysis**

The sensitivity analysis is based on a change in a significant actuarial assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. The following table summarises how the defined benefit obligation as at 30 September 2022 would have increased/(decreased) as a result of a change in the respective assumption by 1 percentage point:

|                         | 1 percent<br>increase | 1 percent<br>decrease |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Discount rate           | (21.9)                | 26.0                  |
| Rate of salary increase | 1.4                   | 1.3                   |

### **Key accounting policies**

All employees of the group are entitled to benefits from the Group's superannuation plan on retirement, disability or death or can direct the group to make contributions to a defined contribution plan of their choice. The Group's superannuation plan has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section. The defined benefit section provides defined lump sum benefits based on years of service and final average salary. The defined contribution section receives fixed contributions from group companies and the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions.

The liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as past service costs.

Contributions to the defined contribution section of the Group's superannuation fund and other independent defined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable.

### **Key estimates and judgments**

The present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date is based on expected future payments arising from membership of the fund. This is calculated annually by independent actuaries considering the expected future wage and salary levels of employees, experience of employee departures and employee periods of service.

Expected future payments are discounted using market yields on corporate bonds at the reporting date, which have terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

### **25. Events subsequent to reporting date**

### **Capital Management**

On 15 November 2022, IPL announced a final dividend of 17 cents per share, 100% franked, to be paid on 21 December 2022. The record date for entitlement to this dividend is 6 December 2022. The total dividend payment will be \$330.2m.

On 15 November 2022, IPL also announced that it intends to undertake an on-market share buy back of up to \$400m. The proposed share buy back will be conducted in the ordinary course of trading and the exact amount and timing of share purchases will be dependent on regulatory requirements and market conditions.

### **Strategic review of WALA and implications for structural separation of the Explosives and Fertilisers businesses**

On 15 November 2022, IPL announced that it has received a number of unsolicited approaches in relation to a potential acquisition of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA). The Company will undertake a review of the strategic options for WALA in the near-term. Under any scenario, IPL intends to maintain the strategic value of long-term supply of ammonia from WALA into the Dyno Nobel Americas business. An estimate of the financial impact cannot be made at this point.

The strategic review process will have implications for the timing of the proposed structural separation of the Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses which was announced on 23 May 2022. It is currently anticipated that the previously communicated target completion date for the separation of early 2023 will likely be extended by 6-12 months, pending the completion of the strategic review process for WALA. There has been no impact on the financial statements for FY2022 in relation to the proposed structural separation other than the costs incurred to date which have been classified as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

Other than the matters reported on above, the directors have not become aware of any other significant matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the financial year, that has affected or may affect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent years, which has not been covered in this report.

### Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Incitec Pivot Limited

 

### *Report on the Audit of the Financial Report*

*Opinion*

We have audited the financial report of Incitec Pivot Limited (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2022, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the *Corporations Act 2001*, including:

- (i) giving a true and fair view of the Group's financial position as at 30 September 2022 and of its financial performance for the year then ended; and
- (ii) complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the *Corporations Regulations 2001*.

### *Basis for Opinion*

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the *Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report* section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the *Corporations Act 2001* and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 *Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards)* (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We confirm that the independence declaration required by the *Corporations Act 2001*, which has been given to the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor's report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

### *Key Audit Matters*

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

{124}------------------------------------------------

### *Other Information*

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Report, which we obtained prior to the date of the auditor's report, and also includes the following information which will be included in the Group's annual report (but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon): About Us company information, Performance and Outlook, Sustainability, Corporate Governance and additional securities exchange information, which is expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed,

{125}------------------------------------------------

we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

### *Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report*

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the *Corporations Act 2001* and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

### *Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report*

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group's audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

{126}------------------------------------------------

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

### Report on the Remuneration Report

### *Opinion on the Remuneration Report*

We have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 63 to 82 of the Director's Report for the year ended 30 September 2022.

In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of the Incitec Pivot Limited, for the year ended 30 September 2022, complies with section 300A of the *Corporations Act 2001*.

### *Responsibilities*

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the *Corporations Act 2001*. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.
